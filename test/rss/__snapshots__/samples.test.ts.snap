<p>Tim has done about four 365 projects in the past six years, shooting daily. “Light painting is, for me, the ultimate form of creativity. If you can visualize something in your imagination there will be a way to achieve this with your camera,” he said. But being an experienced photographer didn&#8217;t save Tim from having his 500px account deleted for “posting non-photographing content.” A few weeks ago, the photo-sharing site mistakenly classified his images as “illustrations,” and suspended his (now reinstated) profile without notice. The incident had a positive outcome though. Tim says the media attention gained from the incident has brought light painting to a wider audience. “It’s also a huge compliment from a personal perspective, as I always strive to produce believable work, so I guess I’m doing something right.”</p>
<p>Flickr’s light painting community was another big source of learning for Tim during his earlier days in photography, particularly the shots and conversations in the <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/lightjunkies/\\">Light Junkies</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/optical-nirvana/\\">Optical Nirvana</a> groups. “I’d sit for hours trying to dissect each shot to get my head around how each effect had been achieved. This is what drove me to improve and keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible during that long exposure.” </p>

<p>What’s amazing about his photos is that the majority of his work is done totally in-camera. “I use many techniques and tools to achieve my images, first and foremost is camera rotation. After seeing work by <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/twincitiesbrightest/\\">TCB</a>, <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/quornflake/\\">Dan Whitaker</a>, <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lededdie\\">LED Eddie</a>, and <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/martinbarras/\\">Mart Barras</a>, I wondered how they had twisted reality in such a way. Camera rotation was the answer. You place your camera on a rig which allows you to rotate the camera around the axis of the lens.” </p>
<p>Tim uses other techniques, such as refractography or lens and tripod swapping, to achieve that unusual, surreal effect. “More recently <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/hugobaptista/\\">Hugo Baptista</a> very kindly shared a number of 3D cross section videos which are really fun to use. He takes a 3D image and cuts it into cross sections on his computer. He then converts this into a kind of 3D scan that plays on a loop. I play these on my phone whilst rotating or panning my camera, and the original 3D image comes back to life.”</p>

<p>Tim, who recently became a brand ambassador for <a href=\\"https://lightpaintingbrushes.com/\\">Light Painting Brushes</a>, says one of the fun aspects of light painting is the fact that the artist gets to create their own tools, using LED lights, acrylics, holographic cards, and any other tool that reflects or emits light. For beginners, he recommends starting with a few basics: a tripod to keep things steady, a camera capable of bulb mode, a wired or wireless trigger, a bright torch, dark clothing so as to not appear in the frame, and a dark location to allow for long exposures. But, the most important thing, he says, is “to have a good imagination.”</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re into light painting, be sure to follow <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/fadetoblacklp\\">Tim Gamble</a>. Flickr is where he got started as a photographer. “I love Flickr due to it being the place I found a wider community of like-minded people from around the globe. It also introduced me to my favorite shooting buddy, <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastchris\\">Chris Thompson</a>, from just over the Pennines in Sheffield. Without his ideas, skills, patience and kind-heartedness most of my favorite light painting images would not exist, and that is all down to a chance meeting on this wonderful platform.”</p>
<p>You may also want to follow the <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/lightpaintingcommunity/\\">Light Painting Community</a> Flickr group, a place where both experienced and beginner light painters can post their photos and share ideas. </p>",

<p>It was time for a reappraisal of sorts. Organizing all the photographs you find inspiring needs to be easy. Really easy. So we built a new way to add all your favorite content to galleries, albums, and groups in one centralized tool from any photo context on Flickr. </p>
<p>All photos on Flickr, wherever you come across them, will now have a new icon with a + that allows you to access a new menu of actions. When you’re looking at photos from other Flickr members, the + will allow you to add that photo to any of your own galleries or if you’re a group admin, invite the photograph’s owner to add that picture to your group. If you’re looking at your own photos, the + will allow you to add your photographs to any of your albums or quickly submit your photo to the groups you are a part of. </p>

Of all the incredible moments captured, we’ve curated a list of the most inspiring photos, which represent a global community of unique perspectives.</p>
<p>To determine top photos, Flickr staff created an algorithm that took into account a number of social and engagement metrics, like how many times the photo was viewed or faved. We made sure to curate the raw data to avoid the results being a popularity contest; we removed spammers and photos that don’t qualify as high-quality. We also tried to ensure diversity of genre. For photographers whose photos placed in the top list multiple times, we selected their top-scoring photo.</p>
<p>We’re proud to present the Top 25 photos of 2018, whose diverse and talented photographers represent 12 different countries around the world.<br />

<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “Photograph of my wife and her ailing father in a nursing home in Puerto Rico. I was standing outside the room just watching when I decided to get my camera and snap a few photographs of them together. Unbeknownst to us all, this trip to visit her father in Puerto Rico would be her last. She passed away due to complications from the removal of a brain tumor three months later. This photo truly illustrates the kind of caring person she was. Her father lives on with a broken heart—she will never be forgotten.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Dan Perez is a self-taught, multiple award-winning documentary filmmaker, photographer and overall nice guy. He was raised in NYC and now calls South Florida home. His films have screened at film festivals in 15 different countries and his photography work has been recognized and awarded by the Photographic Society of America and selected in several international photography competitions and exhibitions. Dan specializes in documentary, photojournalism, live music, and travel photography.</p>

<p><em>“Walking the Line(s)” by Paul Brouns</em></p>

<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “Somewhere in Amsterdam, I noticed these horizontal coloured lines near the entrance area of a building. Instantly recognising this to be an ideal subject, I decided to wait for someone to walk by the wall, in order to get an extra point of reference. In the end, a small dog appeared to be just what I needed to match the composition perfectly.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Paul Brouns is an artist and graphic designer, living near Amsterdam in Holland. Rhythm, color, and geometry are recurring themes in his photographic work and architecture has proven to be an ideal subject for this. He’s attracted to abstract, rhythmic expressions of buildings and tries to visualise that as purely as possible. He believes that no matter how the work is made (direct photography or advanced image editing), what counts is the creation of a feast of dancing shadows, sunlit reflections or color combinations that enchant and inspire the viewer.</p>

<p><em>“Swan Lake” by Volker Woll</em></p>
<div class=\\"flickr-embed\\">
<div class=\\"flickr-image\\"><a data-flickr-embed=\\"true\\" href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69361287@N04/43236091630/\\" title=\\"Swan Lake by v-_-v, on Flickr\\"><img src=\\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1922/43236091630_79e1bc3cb9_b.jpg\\" width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" alt=\\"Swan Lake\\"></a><a href=\\"\\"></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “‘The swan in South Tyrol, Italy’ [‘Swan Lake’] is one of my favorite images because it started out as a fail. Originally, I wanted to photograph a different location, but learned the day before that the road was closed and I couldn’t get there. So I spent the rest of the day scouting the area and finally found this lake called Lago di Dobbiaco that seemed to have potential for a sunrise shoot the next day. This morning, all the pieces fell into place for me: the low hanging clouds, the bit of color from the rising sun, the mist over the lake and the reflection on the calm water&#8230;Believe me when I say, I had to talk that swan into posing for me&#8230;Thanks again, Swan. It&#8217;s these (rare) moments that make up for all the other more common moments when the pieces did not fall into place.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> When he’s not out travelling and taking photos (which is the majority of the time) Volker Woll is living in southern Germany working on software. Funny enough, he met other IT people on those many sunrise shoots (like in “Swan Lake”), so he thinks that landscape photography and software development are just two different shades of nerdy.</p>

<p><em>“Lonely alleys of Venice” by ines_maria</em></p>
<div class=\\"flickr-embed\\">

</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “I arrived by train to Venice in the very early morning—it was freezing cold. I strolled through the streets, the lights were still on in some homes and businesses. After turning into a side alley, peace and an eerie silence spread—it was just the kind of moment I always hope for: in this case, the feeling of loneliness, the dark abandoned silence. Suddenly, quietly, and slowly, these men appeared and disappeared. I knew this was the story I’d been longing to capture.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Ines Maria lives in Vienna and works as an art director at an advertising agency. As a self-taught photographer, her love and passion, as you can imagine, is photography. She believes humans contrasted with our artificial environment (streets and architecture) is a beautiful expression of photography.</p>

<p><em>“Natasza” by Krzysiek Śliwaq</em></p>
<div class=\\"flickr-embed\\">
<div class=\\"flickr-image\\"><a data-flickr-embed=\\"true\\" href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/124055761@N02/45454646581/\\" title=\\"Natasza by Me an Atheist (Krzysiek Śliwaq), on Flickr\\"><img src=\\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1907/45454646581_3096fdb526_b.jpg\\" width=\\"768\\" height=\\"1024\\" alt=\\"Natasza\\"></a><a href=\\"\\"></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “Natasza’s portrait is an example of one of my visions that I have somewhere inside—a simple, classic, close portrait with a bunch of natural emotions enriched by my own patterns of post-processing. Here, I used a dark mood and black and white tones to enhance the perception of her beautiful face, big eyes, and cute freckles. Ambient light made natural and delicate reflections in her eyes and mild skin facture. I tried to catch natural hands setting in the frame as well to make the portrait complete.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Krzysiek Śliwaq was born in 1984 in Poland. He is a solution designer and an enterprise architect in the IT sector working for an international company. He’s a happy husband and a fulfilled father of two remarkable children, who in his free time, takes portraits of young people and sometimes conducts original portrait photography master classes. In his pictures, he’s looking for the real and non-obvious emotions and mood. Krzysiek believes his works are largely a fusion of classic portrait, fashion portrait and fine-art combined with the real charm and authenticity of a child, and with a pinch of dark and intense mood. He enjoys dealing with the two extremes—rawness, naturalness in the message and widely considered in a portrait photography—fine-art. The 80s and 90s, when he was growing up, certainly had a huge impact on his art perception, and he still considers himself to be a big fan of music and cinematography from those times.</p>

<p>The Commons was launched on January 16, 2008, when Flickr released its <a href=\\"http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/01/16/many-hands-make-light-work/\\">pilot project</a> in partnership with <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress\\">The Library of Congress</a>. The two main objectives of the program were to increase discovery and use of publicly-held photography collections and to provide a way for the general public to contribute knowledge through user-generated content (by adding tags, comments, and notes to these historical collections).</p>
<p>In honor of the tremendous growth of this now-11-year-old project, and the 115 <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/commons/institutions/\\">participating institutions</a> that have joined so far, we&#8217;ve created a gallery featuring the images from the Library of Congress (and other Commons member accounts) with the highest number of community-generated tags. Check out the full gallery <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries/72157677774809898/\\">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a sneak peek.  </p>

<p>With 70,400 followers and 33,021 photos uploaded to Flickr, the Library of Congress continues to be one of the largest and most active accounts from The Commons catalog. To celebrate, they are sharing 11 photos related in some way to the number 11 to a new Flickr <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/albums/72157675635280157\\">album</a> focused on the 11th anniversary of The Commons. They&#8217;re posting on the <a href=\\"https://blogs.loc.gov/picturethis/2019/01/celebrating-eleven-years-in-the-flickr-commons/\\">&#8216;Picture this blog&#8217;</a> site as well! </p>
<p>Over the years, the Library of Congress has identified and deciphered the story behind many of the images from its catalog thanks to the expertise and research skills of hundreds of Flickr users. Therefore, we want to take this opportunity to give a special shout-out to users like <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/artolog/\\">Art Siegel</a>, <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/29079609@N02/\\">Kilted Cowboy</a>, <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/21686909@N07/\\">budderflyman</a>, and many other frequent commenters in the community who have been active on the Library of Congress account for years, helping to flesh out names of subjects and providing historical context. Thank you all for your dedication!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in supporting The Commons, please be sure to join the <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrcommons\\">Flickr Commons group</a>, a place for The Commons community to share and discuss the truly awesome collections being made available in The Commons. </p>",

There are a couple very important dates approaching quickly that will affect the features of all Flickr accounts. If you want a quick refresher to know why we’re making changes to Flickr Free accounts and exactly what’s changing, check out this<a href=\\"https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/01/changing-flickr-free-accounts-1000-photos/\\"> blog post</a>.</p>
<h1>Important dates</h1>
<p>January 8, 2019: Free accounts will be limited to 1,000 photos and videos. Free accounts with more than 1,000 items will no longer be able to upload new photos or videos.</p>
<p>February 5, 2019: Any items over the 1,000-upload limit will be at risk of deletion, starting with the oldest of the items. Photos licensed through Creative Commons before November 1, 2018 will not be deleted, even for accounts over the 1,000 limit.</p>
<h1>Upgrading to Flickr Pro</h1>
<p>There’s no place like Flickr to share your photos and grow with other photographers. Upgrading to Flickr Pro gives you unlimited storage, exclusive partner discounts (Adobe Creative Cloud, Peak Design gear, <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=FLICKRPRO15\\">and more</a>), increased exposure on Flickr, ad-free browsing, advanced stats, and more. </p>
<h1>Cheers to you</h1>
<p>We’re extremely proud of what the Flickr community has become. It’s still the largest, most influential group of photographers in the world, and has contributed so much to how photography has grown and changed over the years. That’s one of the reasons we’re keeping a strong <a href=\\"http://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/12/14/photography-and-licensing-qa-with-creative-commons-ceo-ryan-merkley/\\">partnership with Creative Commons</a>. Since we value accessibility to quality photos, we’ve given <a href=\\"https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/07/the-commons-the-past-is-100-part-of-our-future/\\">nonprofits free Pro accounts </a>and encourage all eligible nonprofits to apply by filling out <a href=\\"https://help.flickr.com/en_us/discounts-for-non-profit-organizations-rJio8cn7\\">this form</a>. We’ve also added the ability to gift a Pro account.</p>
<p>2018 has been a big year for Flickr. We’ve carefully listened to your feedback and we’ve already implemented some exciting changes that will make Flickr a better place to grow—like <a href=\\"https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/10/31/we-cant-stand-spam-either/\\">de-spamming</a> and <a href=\\"https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/10/29/bringing-heroic-support-to-flickr/\\">support</a> improvements and plans to improve <a href=\\"https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/10/31/putting-your-best-photo-forward-flickr-updates/\\">photo delivery</a> and <a href=\\"https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/01/leaving-the-yahoo-login-behind/\\">login</a> experience. We can’t wait to share more updates and new features with you in the new year.</p>",

          "value": "<p>Since 2004, Flickr has been a proud supporter of <a href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/\\">Creative Commons</a>, a licensing system that gives photographers and creators the ability to share and distribute their works on conditions of their choice. Today, people can find hundreds of millions of public images released under Creative Commons licenses on our site; we have the honor of being the largest repository of openly licensed works online.</p>
<p>The significance of this massive collection of creative works will always <a href=\\"https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/07/the-commons-the-past-is-100-part-of-our-future/\\"> matter to us</a>— and that&#8217;s why Flickr continues to work with Creative Commons on ways to cultivate and grow this long-term partnership. We recently met with Ryan Merkley, CEO of Creative Commons, to talk about common goals, reflect on the history of our communities, and discuss future challenges and opportunities. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it important for photography platforms like Flickr to support Creative Commons (CC) licenses?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> Because photographers want it. If you want to be a platform that gives its users choice, then CC is the most reliable standard for sharing your work under permissive terms. “All Rights Reserved” is the default for every photo from the second it’s taken, but a considerable portion of users and creators want to share, and a CC license gives them the opportunity to do that. </p>
<p><strong>Allowing CC licenses has helped Flickr grow as a community, to the point that we’ve become the largest repository of CC-licensed images. How has the CC community benefited from Flickr’s support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> A for-profit company [Flickr] every month spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on bandwidth and storage in order to make these images available to every person who wants them, under these terms. That’s a huge gift to the Commons, to history, to the community, to humanity. </p>
<p>Flickr is one of the most, if not the most, important collections of Creative Commons works online. If we lost that, we’d have to move it somewhere and build a platform that could host it, and serve it up in some other way. That infrastructure is really important. We&#8217;ve come to see Flickr as part of the infrastructure of the web, not just a service. It&#8217;s part of the core of what we think of as the “open web.”  </p>
<p><strong>Why do you think so many people choose Flickr for sharing and accessing Creative Commons images?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> I think a huge part of the goodwill that exists for Flickr is tied to this notion that it was built around the ideals of sharing and bringing communities together, so it was more than just a photo platform. </p>
<p>Wikipedia and Flickr are part of this old web that people still love, and it&#8217;s one of the few for-profit companies that has been able to hold those values through sell after sell. That says something about the people that work at Flickr, about the people who purchased Flickr, about the community that stayed with Flickr.</p>
<p><strong>Flickr takes copyright very seriously, but we believe creators should have the choice to decide the type of license and conditions they wish to apply to their work. What would you say to photographers who criticize the Creative Commons because they think it creates a body of work that competes with their ability to make money? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> Creative Commons was designed to give authors and creators choice. In an environment where copyright is the default, every creator has to choose to share or not to share.</p>
<p>If a photographer makes a work and they don&#8217;t want to share it, they shouldn&#8217;t. Creative Commons is not going to come and take their work from them; we never would. We made a set of licenses with different permissions because some photographers were willing to share and only wanted credit, and other photographers were willing to share but also wanted to make sure that they were the only ones who could profit commercially.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Do you believe photographers have a good general understanding of the different types of CC licenses they can apply to their work, and the implications of choosing one of these licenses? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> I think photographers, more than most creators, have a pretty good grip on their copyright. I think there are nuances of the licenses people don&#8217;t quite get. People understand that CC-BY means that “I must give credit,” but they probably get stuck on “what does ‘give credit’ mean?” </p>
<p>A piece of the licenses requires some goodwill and good actors, and when you have bad actors, then people need to work it out. But I can say that over seventeen years of the life of Creative Commons, two things have been consistent: when the licenses are under scrutiny and they go to court, the license terms hold up and the rights of creators are upheld. The number of cases where that&#8217;s happened is very few because, most often, people work it out.</p>
<p>The licenses were not supposed to be a big hammer that you hit people with; they&#8217;re supposed to enable collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>We often see examples of people, including journalists, who forget to give proper attribution to the photographer, or give attribution to the platform instead. What has CC done over the years to help creators understand the benefits of using an open license and to educate the public on how to properly attribute and use those CC-licensed works? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> We provide educational materials. We go meet with our partners and do videos in their offices and talk to them about how to do this. In our own products, we&#8217;re building a service called <a href=\\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/\\">CC Search</a>. The idea is to collect all the works of the Commons and provide front-door access to them. We&#8217;ve built one-click attribution as well. </p>
<p>Where I&#8217;d like to get to is a place where attribution is automatic so that the user doesn’t have to do anything. </p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us more about the Creative Commons Search initiative? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> CC Search, when it&#8217;s completed, will be a collection of the catalog of the Commons online—so 1.4 billion licensed works across 9 million different websites, from Flickr, Wikipedia, Youtube…all the way down to someone’s individual blog. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever get everything, but the idea is to collect the majority of that in a catalog that refers to the various places where those works are located. </p>
<p><strong>The European Parliament has recently voted in favor of the Copyright Directive, which includes the controversial “link tax” and “upload filter,” two proposals you’ve publicly criticized. How do you think this directive would affect creators and platforms like Flickr if given final approval in January?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> The link tax gives a right to publishers to link to their sites and was designed around journalism businesses’ frustration over Google News, based on an assumption that if they can make money out of those links that Google News offers, they would somehow be viable again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve already seen both in Germany and Spain that making laws like that has failed. When, in Spain, Google News shut down their service in response to the restrictions imposed by the government, news websites saw their traffic drop drastically overnight. So whatever advertising those sites were getting from traffic vanished. </p>
<p>The other policy that they would bring in is the upload filtering, which would require every piece of content uploaded to be filtered prior to it being posted. This is meant to deal with what its proponents described as “rampant copyright infringement.” Our sense is that what it mostly does is lock out new players because, in order to do that kind of filtering, you would require AI filters or huge armies of people.</p>
<p>That probably means that only the companies that can afford those filters will have them. And the only companies that have those filters right now are Google and Facebook.</p>

</div>
<p>Though we know there will always be new challenges like those proposed by the European Parliament, we at Flickr will continue to work together with Creative Commons to provide photographers with a safe place to share their photos—however they choose. The landscape of sharing online will continue to change, and we&#8217;ll continue to adapt and collaborate in order to protect this repository of amazing images.</p>",

<p>Stats have long been an important feature for the Flickr community. Going beyond the social aspect of photo sharing with mere faves and comments, Flickr stats provide valuable insight about your photos’ performance, views, and popularity. Whether you use stats to understand which of your photos are well-received to improve your photography or you just enjoy getting feedback in data form about your favorite shots, Flickr stats are crucial. </p>
<p>That’s why we’re happy to announce that we’re bringing advanced stats for our Flickr Pros to our mobile apps. Now no matter where you are or what you’re doing, you can grab a quick peek into the performance of your photos right from your mobile device. </p>
<p>To find your stats in the mobile app, tap the “person” icon and scroll right across the navigation until you see that “Stats” heading. We’ll be rolling this feature out over the next few days, so be sure to update to the latest version of the Flickr app. </p>
<p>Stats are limited only to Flickr Pros. If you’re ready to see how your photos stack up, you can upgrade to Flickr Pro for stats, unlimited storage, new 5K display resolution, partner discounts, and more. And if you hurry you can get 15% off your first year. Just upgrade by January 1, 2019.  <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=flickrpro15&amp;select&amp;utm_campaign=flickr-launch-15&amp;utm_source=Flickr&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=mobile-stats\\">Learn more here</a>. </p>",

<p>You in? <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/yourbestshot2018/\\">Join the group</a> now and submit your single best shot between December 1, 2018, and January 7, 2019 (for extra time to edit those fabulous New Year photos). The only rule for your submission is that had to be uploaded in 2018—it doesn’t matter when it was taken. We know it’s like picking your favorite child, but you may only submit one photo. Choose wisely!</p>
<p>Throughout December, Flickr staff will curate submissions and share themed galleries. You can count on these photos getting awesome exposure: our favorites from each gallery will be featured on the Flickr blog and social-media channels through early 2019. </p>
<p>Get a head start browsing through your portfolio before submissions open on Dec.1. We’re stoked to celebrate <a href=\\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/yourbestshot2018/\\">Your Best Shot 2018</a> with the Flickr community and can’t wait to see your photos!</p>

Steph and Harris spoke about the benefits of publishing on Medium, shared a few of their favorite stories, explained how the <a href=\\"https://medium.com/creators\\">metered paywall</a> works, and gave their advice for writers.</p><p>In response, many Medium writers (and readers) expressed gratitude and excitement about our efforts to “elevate” independent voices on the platform. Many were inspired to self-publish more stories this year and to — in Georgopulos’ words — “focus on finding their voice.”</p><p>We also received some great questions in the responses about how Steph and Harris do what they do, which we answer below.</p><p><strong>How do I make sure my story is seen by Medium’s editors?</strong></p><p>The best way to make sure we see your story is to focus on quality. Our curators use our published <a href=\\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006362473-Medium-s-Curation-Guidelines-Everything-Writers-Need-to-Know\\">curation guidelines</a> to review posts for distribution and flag promising ones to us. We’re always searching for great writing that’s hiding beneath the surface.</p><p>When we do find something we love, we reach out to the writer. To make sure you receive our offers to feature your work, check the “Notifications on your stories” box in your <a href=\\"https://medium.com/me/settings\\">email settings</a>.</p><p><strong>What subject areas do you focus on? How do you decide which stories are featured?</strong></p><p>We’re primarily looking for general interest stories that will resonate with our readers — relevant, authentic, compelling perspectives that help us understand ourselves and the world around us. Within that, there’s a lot of variety. Here are a few of our favorites from the past month, to give you a sense of the range of stories we work on:</p><p>A reflection on the consequences of climate change — and plastic — by writer and comedian <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/5890e7941a4b\\">Andy Haynes</a>: “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/story/unpackaging-1b77bb959833\\">One Nation, Wrapped in Plastic</a>”</p><p>Amazon software engineer <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/bf71ba35bb4f\\">Bhavya Kashyap</a> on the narrow definition of engineering perpetuated by coding bootcamps: “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/story/you-cant-build-an-iphone-with-python-ad690e5b2164\\">You Can’t Build an iPhone with Python</a>”</p><p>Reporter <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/bf0df4aebaa7\\">Yuming Fang</a> visited a maternal hotel in California, where women from abroad travel to give birth in the U.S.: “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/story/inside-the-world-of-birth-tourism-4d6e382346b0\\">Inside the World of Birth Tourism</a>”</p><p>Journalist <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/7183e221ac5a\\">Jon Ward</a> on our hyper-polarizing political moment — and how we might be able to come together: “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/story/the-gravitron-e2820c1d95f3\\">How to Get Off the Nauseating Thrill Ride of U.S. Politics</a>”</p><p>Poet <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/e550c175978b\\">Jessica Semaan</a> on learning to listen to yourself: “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/story/to-become-the-woman-i-am-e09fd6fd9ceb\\">To Become the Woman I Am</a>”</p><p>A 100-plus-year-old slice of history that contextualizes the world we live in now, by <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/ea364511a5a9\\">Catherine Prendergast</a>: “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/story/what-an-abortion-felt-like-in-1907-10246f91a743\\">What Abortion Was Like in 1907</a>”</p><p>We are working on expanding our topic coverage and increasing the number of stories we can workshop. We’re planning to go deep on lots of topics including niche areas we know our members are interested in — like cryptocurrency and digital design. A first step toward doing that is hiring more editors. Recently, we posted three open positions: Platform Editors for <a href=\\"https://jobs.lever.co/medium/f18cbfd7-c30e-403d-ada3-9e07a032064a\\">Politics</a>, <a href=\\"https://jobs.lever.co/medium/1a67659c-7b62-4cca-ba59-22734c72da05\\">Design</a>, and <a href=\\"https://jobs.lever.co/medium/b3b6121e-ea70-46f4-9fb8-99309eb39733\\">Cryptocurrency</a>. We encourage anyone obsessed with great writing to apply.</p><p><strong>Do you consider stories that aren’t written by writers enrolled in the Partner Program?</strong></p><p>Yes — we review stories by all writers equally, regardless of whether the writer is in the Partner Program. When we find a great story that’s not eligible to be part of our <a href=\\"https://medium.com/creators\\">metered paywall</a>, we reach out to the writer to ask them to meter it as part of the elevating process. We also encourage them to sign up for the <a href=\\"https://medium.com/creators\\">Partner Program</a> to earn money based on member engagement. We pay on a royalty model, so stories keep paying off, as long as people are engaging with them. We’ve designed our Partner Program payment system to reward quality, and we’re always adjusting and working to improve that system. So we encourage writers to do the type of work that has lasting value. As our subscriber base grows, we will increase the payouts that go to partner writers (as well as increase our commissioning budget).</p><p><strong>How do you avoid favoritism? How do you make sure you’re promoting diverse voices?</strong></p><p>A few specific parts of our process keep us honest. We review stories and writers at the end of each month to gut check our output: For example, we look at the percentage of recurring writers vs. new writers. (Last quarter, over 70 percent of Elevated stories came from authors we’ve never worked with before.) We also look at supply and demand in the topics our members read most to determine our areas of focus. While taste (or preference) plays a large role in our work, data provides the framework for much of it.</p><p>That’s not to say it informs every decision we make — we believe, at minimum, in using a blend of science and taste — but it does help us prioritize. We have plans to expand this program in 2019 (and beyond), and we hope to explore new areas of opportunity that aren’t necessarily reflected in the data.</p><p>Lastly, we have a curation team of more than ~20 curators based around the world. They do the lion’s share of distributing stories via Topics (which also power recommendations on the homepage and the Daily Digest). Our curators make up a pretty diverse group, representing five continents and a range of backgrounds, from teaching to writing to technology. Their work is set up in such a way that a single curator doesn’t usually review the same writer every time. Our curation system (built by our amazing engineers) supports that work — and ours.</p><p><strong>Do you work with non-English-speaking writers?</strong></p><p>Not currently — but as we scale, we hope we’ll be able to.</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=99e62f56714a\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/answering-your-questions-for-mediums-elevators-99e62f56714a\\">Answering Your Questions for Medium’s “Elevators”</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I joined this organization about a year ago, and I’ve had the privilege of working with our employee-driven and cross-functional Diversity and Inclusion Committee whose mission is to increase, promote, and improve diversity and inclusion at Medium.</p><p>We aspire to become a more inclusive and diverse company, but we’ve been working largely in our own bubble, and with mixed results. Some of our initiatives have gone really well. For example our book club has led to great relationship and community building within our organization. Other initiatives have stalled out: figuring out productive ways for the committee to get involved in our recruiting operation.</p><p>Midway through 2018, I started to feel like I had run out of energy and ideas around D&amp;I. I sensed that my fellow committee members were also growing restless: frustrated by our lack of concrete action and results in terms of increasing the diversity of our employee community at senior levels, particularly when it comes to Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latin representation. See our 2018 Diversity Report <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/medium-the-diversity-report-503dd91c2edd\\">here</a>. We have the data, but we need to get better at taking action that yields better results.</p><p>There is so much to be gained by reaching out to the broader D&amp;I community, yet we haven’t been tapping into this collective wisdom. During one of our committee meetings, we asked ourselves, “Why aren’t we asking for help? Why aren’t we sharing what we’ve learned with other organizations? Surely others have stories and experiences that we could learn from? How do we reignite our passion and energy around D&amp;I? How do we stay curious when this conversation is so hard?”</p><p>Maybe you’ve felt this same restlessness and isolation at some point in your respective journeys. <strong>We want to hear from you.</strong></p><p>One of my goals for 2019 is to better connect with others who are passionate about diversity and inclusion — people who range from D&amp;I professionals, consultants, researchers, and enthusiast to those who drive change through influence within their organizations (e.g. ERG leads, team members on committees) to share ideas, challenges, and wins, and to learn from each other.</p><p>We’re creating a safe space for smart and passionate people to come together and to ask hard questions, share experiences and insights, and to learn from one another. This will be in the form of an event that we’ll host, and we hope it will be the first of many.</p><p>The Medium D&amp;I Committee is hosting a gathering on <strong>February 13, 2019 at 6pm in San Francisco</strong>. If you are committed to increasing and promoting diversity and inclusion at your company or in tech, in general, we’d like to send you an invitation to join our evening of lively yet judgment-free conversation. <a href=\\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gathering-medium-for-diversity-inclusion-practitioners-tickets-55545575311\\"><strong>Please reserve your ticket here</strong></a><strong> as soon as possible, as space is limited. </strong>Even if you aren’t able to attend this event, we’d love to be connected. We’ll also make sure to share out any key insights and learnings from our conversations and post those to Medium in future posts.</p><p>The format of the event will be as follows:</p><p>6–6:45 Networking (there will be food &amp; beverages)</p><p>6:45–7:45 Moderated Panel</p><p>7:45–8:45 Breakout discussions</p><p>Thank you all for reading, and we hope you’ll join us.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Pema</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bd1489f05a1d\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/an-honest-and-open-letter-to-the-d-i-community-bd1489f05a1d\\">An Honest and Open Letter to the D&amp;I Community</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Diversity for us includes, but is not limited to, gender, ethnicity, race, culture, socio-economic background, religion, age, physical ability, veteran status, country of origin, primary language, sexuality, political preference, education, and family makeup.</p><h3>The Data</h3><p>Every year, we send an optional survey to our staff to gather demographic information and give employees a chance to voice whether they feel our workplace is diverse and inclusive. We sent the survey to staff hired up until November 13, 2018 and the responses are valid as of November 30, 2018. A few notes on the data:</p><ul><li>The survey is anonymous and optional for all employees. Contractors were not included in this survey. In order to capture some of the subgroups of the survey, we cross-referenced survey data with our internal HR data.</li><li>We separate our statistics into tech — which includes engineering, product, and data science — and non-tech, which includes (but is not limited to) marketing, content, operations, human resources, and design. We do not separate the demographics for other functional groups because their small size precludes anonymity.</li><li>Senior employees are defined as individuals who are in one of the top three levels of our six-tier internal leveling system.</li></ul><h3>Who We Are</h3><p>As of November 13, 2018, we are comprised of 98 employees that identify mostly as introverts and ambiverts. We enjoy both outdoor and indoor activities, with a slight preference for staying indoors. Our current employees are based all over the US, with 75% of the company in San Francisco, 15% in New York and the rest working remotely. The largest team is engineering (46% of Medium) followed by Editorial (13%) and Product (11%).</p><h3>Gender</h3><p>The overall gender split for Medium is 39.6% (-0.6 percentage points from 2017) female and 60.4% male. For the tech roles, the split is 31.5% (-6.5pp from 2017) female and 68.5% male, while for non-tech roles, the ratio of female and male employees is even at 50% (+14pp for female held positions from 2017). In senior positions, we have 27.5% (+4.7pp from 2017) of the positions filled by female employees and the remaining 72.5% filled by male employees.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IfWNVVOnUcitMyHO\\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mRTGeQSDBjwNpeWD\\" /></figure><h3>Race &amp; Ethnicity</h3><p>The current makeup of Medium is 63% of employees that identify as White. That’s an increase of +5pp from the previous year. There are also 24% of employees identifying as Asian, which represents an increase of +2pp from 2017. We have 9% of employees that identify as Black or African American and that’s a decrease of -2pp from last year. Other groups saw a marginal increase of +1–2pp from 2017.</p><p>We do not have any Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latinx employees at the senior level.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*AgFQ6X8nwHSOSWFK\\" /></figure><h3>Age, LGBTQ+ &amp; Origin</h3><p>There are other areas of diversity that we measure:</p><ul><li>Most of our employees are between 26–30 years old, but there was a decrease of -8pp from the previous year. The company is trending older and now more than 50% of the employees are 31 years and older.</li><li>14% of our employees identify as LGBTQ+, a jump of +4.3pp from 2017.</li><li>Most Medians were born in America but there’s a significant number (45%) of employees that are either immigrants or born of parents that are immigrants.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MltblTnZpD6E4tOQ\\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*pi6trHyBDkhxCFqb\\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wK5HLnzn_WqBlg59\\" /></figure><h3>Inclusion</h3><p>We asked employees who they felt should be better represented at Medium. Combining direct answers to this question with free-form comments, 61% of respondents expressed a desire for a more diverse leadership team. Other areas where people felt Medium lacks diverse representation include: race &amp; ethnicity, age, and political views.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SytbY7TWSIWk59Uk\\" /></figure><p>The free form comments also capture that as we continue to grow and become increasingly distributed as a workforce, we have an opportunity to ensure better parity around benefits and social events between remote worker and workers in our San Francisco office.</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=503dd91c2edd\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/medium-the-diversity-report-503dd91c2edd\\">Medium: The Diversity Report</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Now, they work to “elevate” with independent, self-published writers on Medium. Georgopulos and Sockel scour Medium to find great stories they think deserve a wider audience than they may otherwise be getting.</p><p>They reach out to the writer and work with them on improving their piece, then distribute it broadly through Medium’s topics, publications, homepage, emails, and social channels.</p><p>Medium VP, Editorial Siobhan O’Connor explained the various ways that the editorial team <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887\\">works with writers</a> — from the commissioned stories in our monthly magazine to exclusive columnists, plus reported features and insightful essays. She also described how we work with writers self-publishing on Medium — and this interview explains that in greater detail.</p><p><strong>Hi there. Can you tell us what you do?</strong></p><p><strong>Harris Sockel</strong>: We’re finding great writers on Medium and working with them to develop their stories to reach a wider audience. Basically, we work to find compelling voices and build relationships.</p><p><strong>How did you begin working at Medium?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephanie Georgopulos</strong>: I’ve been writing on Medium since the site was in beta. I built a publication called <a href=\\"https://medium.com/human-parts\\">Human Parts</a> on Medium back in 2013, and Harris was one of my first contributors.</p><p>About a year in, I needed help managing the number of submissions I was receiving, and I felt that Harris’s writing embodied the spirit of what I wanted Human Parts to be. We met up for a drink and by the time we left, I had my partner. I joined Medium full time in 2016 as a curator, and you can guess the rest from there.</p><p>The majority of the writers Harris and I ended up working with on Human Parts started out self-publishing on Medium as well. What we do now — looking for great writing, and not really knowing what we’re going to find when we arrive at work in the morning — originates with that editorial experience.</p><p><strong>What draws you to this kind of work — collaborating with writers from the platform?</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: There’s a raw enthusiasm from a lot of these writers, who just <em>had</em> to publish these stories, even without confirmation that payment and readers would be waiting.</p><p>I’ve been a freelance writer before; I’ve written things just to make fifty dollars. So, I understand there can be a different energy that goes into something you’re writing for an assignment versus something you’re writing for yourself.</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I’ve learned a lot getting to work with experts who write about their industries. Medium is home to doctors, scientists, designers — leaders in their fields. And they don’t necessarily want to be career writers, but they have expertise that’s really valuable.</p><p><strong>Can you talk a bit about what writers get out of self-publishing on Medium?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I think writing on Medium means the opportunity to reach a wide audience without the overhead of creating your own blog. You don’t need a reputation, followers, or any type of pre-ordained cred to write here and find people willing to listen.</p><p><strong>Georgopoulos</strong>: If the Medium <a href=\\"https://medium.com/creators\\">Partner Program</a> had existed when I was a freelancer, I would’ve had more options. I’ve had lovely relationships with editors, but at the end of the day, they have to commission stories that make sense for their publication and audience. So when writing is your primary income, you have to make choices about which ideas to pursue. And I think the Partner Program means writers don’t have to choose — you can pitch a big, ambitious idea to an editor, and you can also write something for which there is no natural, obvious publisher. You can monetize your killed stories, your tweetstorms . . . Medium’s always been good for writing first and placing later, but now you can get paid, too. I think a lot of us have trained ourselves to write what we can sell to publishers, but when you’re “selling” directly to readers, you can create and respond to your own audience rather than borrowing one. This is essentially what we do on social media already, for free.</p><p><strong>It goes back to the idea that all of our output on digital publishing platforms and even social media websites is a form of work.</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: Right. On many sites and platforms, the work you’re doing — there are ads being sold against it. Medium has always been . . . people call it longform Twitter, but I don’t think it’s like Twitter at all. It’s a place to parse things, not just throw them out there and forget about them later.</p><p>I like processing my thoughts through writing without feeling like I need to have something massive to say every single time. Or that I need a news angle just to speak. And I think that’s been a huge problem with the internet, particularly with personal essays. To sell, it always has to be confessional or</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: This huge revelation —</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: Your most private thoughts.</p><p>Sometimes it’s okay to find meaning in lightness.</p><p><strong>What’s an example of a story like that? That felt urgent even if it wasn’t timely?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/@kristicoulter/https-medium-com-kristicoulter-the-24-hour-woman-3425ca5be19f\\">Enjoli</a>” by <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/28cf82519e71\\">Kristi Coulter</a>. It’s a very personal (and very funny) essay about getting sober in a culture where everyone seems to be drinking all the time. I remember when I first read it (Steph sent it to me) and it was that feeling of, this is the story that she had to tell, and she’s telling it in her own way — she’s writing it for herself.</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: And it led to Kristi getting a book deal — her first book of essays, <em>Nothing Good Can Come from This,</em> was published last summer by Macmillan. It’s pretty heady to go to work everyday not knowing what opportunities it might create for someone else.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fjT6DYcaHsxY4vqYrPBAjA.jpeg\\" /></figure><p><strong>What’s a story that more recently came through that you really enjoyed?</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: There are so many, but “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/story/living-in-deep-time-f395dc4b8f56\\">Living in Deep Time</a>” by <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/ec52805c38e8\\">Elizabeth Childs</a> was one I really loved on a personal level. As many women noted during and since, the Kavanaugh confirmation illustrated to women how our culture regards and values our experiences, and frankly, that picture was monstrous. Throughout the trial I read many personal accounts that echoed Christine Blasey Ford’s, a lot of articles making logical arguments about why this confirmation couldn’t move forward. And in the aftermath, when it did, it kind of felt like . . . do our words matter that little? Why even bother? “Living in Deep Time” reminded me why we bother. It reminded me that you can seize power without stealing it.</p><p><strong>Writers are motivated by different things. How do you tailor your approach for each person?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: Every writer is different. Some want to earn money from their work and build careers in writing. Others want to share expertise they’ve gained from working in another industry, so targeted distribution to a niche audience might be more what they’re looking for. The same goes for editing: some writers want to develop a relationship with an editor, and others want to do their own thing. It really depends, and there are all kinds of writers along the spectrum. Our relationships vary depending on the person, their goals, and their work.</p><p><strong>Tell us about the metered paywall.</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: The stories we work on are chosen for, and funded by, our subscribers, so everything we work on goes behind our metered paywall. We’re an ad-free platform, so we’re less concerned about every piece getting tons of traffic and more concerned with making sure the readers who invest in a subscription are getting value out of that.</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I think writers are starting to see that if you put something behind the meter, the work can go much further. It’s also just thrilling, personally, to see how much more engagement a piece can get after it goes through our process. <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/3e878c7f3f5\\">Lydia Sohn</a>’s “<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/youthnow/what-its-like-to-be-90-something-368780082573\\">What Do 90-Somethings Regret Most</a>?” is a great example. I found that story through our inbound tips line (any writer can send a story to <a href=\\"mailto:tips@medium.com\\">tips@medium.com</a> — we get to all of them eventually). Sohn is a minister and writer in San Diego, and in the story she describes interviewing her oldest congregants about their hopes, fears, and regrets. It was obvious Sohn came to the interviews with a lot of empathy (and came away with a new perspective on aging). When I found the story, almost no one had seen it. She’s had a lot of success from that piece, and readers got a lot out of the insights in it.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZWnvW7A7guMIRJvnq4Pa3A.jpeg\\" /></figure><p><strong>What do you want writers to know about Medium?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I want more people to understand that you can get paid to write what you want to write. I don’t think people quite get that yet. And this doesn’t just go for essayists — I’m waiting for more independent journalists and industry experts outside of tech to try it out.</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: And I want people to worry less about “what works” and focus on finding their voice. There’s just really no way to skip the line when it comes to that. The stories that hit me hardest are the ones I didn’t know I wanted, and in my experience those resonate because they’re coming from this one-of-a-kind place only that writer has access to. Their perspective. That lifetime that got them here. That’s what I’m looking for in a story. I’m reading all day long, so something really needs to jump out and have an authentic, fresh voice for me to be able to stick with it from beginning to end. There are only so many hours.</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I probably have a thousand tabs open.</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: Tabs all day long. It’s extremely exciting and refreshing to find that one where you think, “Ah, this is so good.”</p><p><em>We answer writers’ questions in a follow-up post </em><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/answering-your-questions-for-mediums-elevators-99e62f56714a\\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=92ab3c47abc8\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/meet-the-medium-elevators-92ab3c47abc8\\">Meet the Medium “Elevators”</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We’ve found different ways to <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887\\">work with writers</a>. We’ve invested aggressively in editorial. And we’ve bridged the gap between platform and publisher.</p><p>Tens of thousands of pieces are published on Medium every day. We also commission hundreds every month. And every month, we also work with hundreds of Medium native writers on their work. All of that is reflected here.</p><p>Picking favorites is never easy. Read on for a small selection of the pieces that inspired us, moved us, and amused us — and sometimes managed to do all three.

In a sweeping, brave personal essay, Daum chronicles how her search for political nuance in an obnoxiously polarized era led her to a handful of thinkers — disdained within her progressive social circle — known as the intellectual dark web. At the same time, she was mourning the end of her marriage and the loss of her intellectual sparring partner. The result is a smart, searching look at Daum’s personal and political evolution. It’s something we can all learn from in these fractured times. It will give you chills, if not make you cry, and it’s why we’re going to be working more closely with this important writer starting in January.</p><p>— <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/98ac79723788\\">Siobhan O&#39;Connor</a>, vice president, editorial</p><h4><a href=\\"https://medium.com/@robdelaney_50150/note-i-wrote-all-of-this-except-the-last-paragraph-in-april-or-may-of-2017-6b8f5e702533\\">I’m on the Bus to Go See My Son at the Hospital</a> by <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/6da5486ee164\\">Rob Delaney</a></h4><p>Rob Delaney’s essay about the illness and death of his son Henry haunts me months after I first read it.

In his early forties, after things came to a head, he started trail running, and he kept trail running. In doing so, Flannery discovered a community of people who have responded to midlife crises by tackling increasingly intense physical challenges.

In this essay, writer Sophie Kleeman probes with refreshing honesty her decision to become a U.S. citizen in 2018 and helps us understand why we keep pressing on.

Firefighters? Brave. “The other woman”? Not at first blush. But while women in Haukka’s position are rarely recognized as brave — let alone sympathetic — these apologies to her husband’s ex-wife are honest, vulnerable, and, for this reader, haunting. This spin on an open letter is more than an apology; it’s a painful, public display of humility and regret, a woman eating her curdled just-desserts. Or maybe it’s a modern parable: not on the pitfalls of cheating, but on the consequences of lying to yourself in the name of love.</p><p>— <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/f86b4ebd8b2a\\">Stephanie Georgopulos</a>, lead, platform writers</p><h4><a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/powertrip/confessions-of-a-u-s-postal-worker-we-deliver-amazon-packages-until-we-drop-dead-a6e96f125126\\">Confessions of a U.S. Postal Worker</a> by <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/480f8535b286\\">Brendan O&#39;Connor</a></h4><p>Over the past two years, the U.S. Postal Service has become something of a political football in the ongoing battle between the Trump administration and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon. It’s hard to know who to root for.

We powered through it: nine reporters, 46 teens, six artists. The most ardent tasks are often the most worthwhile.

A send-up of a major tech company run by megalomaniacs and weirdos, <em>The Big Disruption</em> is both a love letter and a sharp critique of Silicon Valley — insightful in its complaints but also laugh-out-loud funny.

Sara Benincasa’s essay is a eulogy, a meditation, and a searingly honest reflection on depression, suicide, and mental health.

She really gets at the nuanced silver lining that shines at the intersection of apathy, surveillance, political power, economics, hopelessness, and good old-fashioned self-care.

It helped me understand empathy and identity without ever using those words. This is about Roxane’s decision to have weight-loss surgery and her life inside an “unruly body,” but it is also about the emotional hunger of humanity.</p><p>— <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/d07ce44c4aac\\">Matt Higginson</a>, partnerships</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e9edd5b655d8\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/the-stories-that-moved-us-in-2018-e9edd5b655d8\\">The Stories That Moved Us in 2018</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

          "value": "<h4>We’re investing heavily in editorial and the Partner Program</h4><p>As many of you have noticed, we’ve been building out a team of editors and curators at Medium over the last several months. This is exciting. Our goal is simple: put terrific stories in front of our readers and, notably, our <a href=\\"https://medium.com/membership\\">subscribers</a>.</p><p>Writers are motivated by different things, so we work with them in a number of ways. Some writers want to work with an editor, others do not. Some want to reach as many people as possible, others want to reach a targeted, hyper-engaged audience of their industry peers. Some, but not all, want to earn money for their work.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gvvd_S-f0zUjYkpA5CvRZA.png\\" /></figure><p>So our editorial team is versatile and varied. Some of us are commissioning stories. We have exclusive columnists, like the feminist writer <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/e40c977f7a17\\">Jessica Valenti</a> and the longtime tech and media thinker <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/881540f516d3\\">douglas rushkoff</a>; we also commission <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62\\">reported features</a>, <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/greatescape/nuance-a-love-story-ae6a14991059\\">essays</a>, <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/the-nuance\\">explainers</a>, and <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/traveling-while-black\\">diverse</a> <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/voices-from-chicago\\">voices</a> all the time. We just published a whole <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/the-big-disruption/why-i-left-my-big-fancy-tech-job-and-wrote-a-book-b64c40484774\\">book</a>. Finally, we really like collections at Medium; they possess an internal logic that’s pleasing to readers (and they’re fun for editors to put together, too). You can find them all over <a href=\\"http://medium.com/collections\\">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Medium’s business model is designed to serve writers and readers — that’s it.</blockquote><p>In Medium magazine, which debuted in June and has a new theme every month — like July’s <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/futurehuman\\">Future Human</a> and October’s <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/powertrip\\">Power Trip</a> — we publish stories by journalists and other writers we admire. We also put together topic-based collections, such as <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/the-crypto-collection\\">The Crypto Collection</a>, <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/the-edge-of-adulthood\\">The Edge of Adulthood</a>, or <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/art-of-code\\">The Art of Code</a>. Many of these collections contain both commissioned stories as well as great stories by writers on the platform. (<a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/not-another-first-time-story\\">This one</a> features all writers who self-publish on Medium, and it’s awesome.)</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects of our editorial operation is the growing team of editors dedicated to scouring the self-published stories on Medium each day to find expert and emerging voices that we want to share with readers. When we find stories we love, which happens many, many times every day, we reach out to the writer.</p><p>We’ll workshop their piece to varying degrees, as well as giving it a copy edit, production support, and nice art, and then we promote it. Many of these stories also get featured on the homepage and app or included in themed <a href=\\"https://medium.com/collections\\">collections</a>, where they live alongside commissioned stories.</p><blockquote>When we find stories we love on the platform, which happens many, many times every day, we reach out to the writer.</blockquote><p>Some of those indie writers are in the <a href=\\"http://medium.com/creators\\">Partner Program</a>, which anyone can join, and when they do, they stand to earn money based on engagement with their work. (What’s especially cool about the Partner Program is that writers can continue to earn cash on a story as long as members continue to engage with it — kind of like royalties.) There are tens of thousands of people in the Partner Program, and we’ve been working with a growing number of them directly.</p><p>Lastly, while poking around Medium, you may have also noticed more <a href=\\"https://medium.com/topic/book-excerpts\\">book excerpts</a>. We’re excited about these and have a full-time editor finding forthcoming books we think Medium readers will love. (She’s also the editor behind the aforementioned <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/the-big-disruption\\">book</a> we published by a former Google exec, whose work, while fiction, reads like a tell-all.) We pay competitively to license these excerpts the same way we would commission a story; we don’t sell placement to publishers.</p><p>Before I go: Medium’s business model is designed to serve writers and readers — that’s it. It’s why we moved away from the race-to-the-bottom incentives of advertising, not to mention its distracting banners, junky pop-ups, sponsored recirc units, auto-play video, and data trackers that follow you around the internet. You won’t see any of that on Medium, and that’s because we don’t accept advertising. Instead, we have a metered paywall and a <a href=\\"https://medium.com/membership\\">subscription service</a>, which costs $5 per month or $50 per year.</p><p>For those not up on the industry lingo, here’s how a metered paywall works: Everyone can read several paywalled stories for free every month; people who subscribe can read them all. (You can read an explanation from our founder and CEO Ev Williams on <a href=\\"https://medium.com/@ev/the-rationalization-of-publishing-dc001d509de8\\">why we launched the paywall</a>, and you can get more detail about the model from <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/the-medium-model-3ec28c6f603a\\">Ev</a> and from a recent <a href=\\"https://digiday.com/media/siobhan-oconnor-trying-make-medium-subscription-driven/\\">Digiday article</a> about our subscription business, and how it’s working.)</p><p>It is indeed working very well so far — which is great news for writers, because as our business grows, so does our investment in paying them well for their work. Our editorial budget increases every month as subscribers increase, which is happening quickly. We also spend a comparatively small amount of money syndicating stories from other publications that we present to our subscribers ad-free. (NB: Syndicated and commissioned stories do not earn money from the pool we use to pay Partner Program writers.) By the end of the year, we will have spent nearly $5 million in 2018 alone paying commissioned and Partner Program writers for their work.</p><p>We are always working — with writers and with each other — to make this place special.</p><p>Medium was built for writers, and we believe it remains the best place on the internet for writing and reading. Thank you for helping us make it great.</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4c7844560887\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887\\">How Medium Works With Writers</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

          "value": "<p>We’ve been putting our <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/the-medium-model-3ec28c6f603a\\">energy at Medium</a> into improving quality — hosting more thoughtful and carefully written content, and improving the reading experience. We want to eliminate distractions that get in the way of reading flow and reduce distortions that could undermine your trust in what you read on Medium.</p><p>To that end, we‘re adjusting our policies related to commercial content.</p><h3>Ads, Promotions, and Marketing</h3><p>First, we’ll be restricting some kinds of commercial activity that have been allowed in the past, such as sponsorships and links that are mainly promotional. Medium’s business has been ad-free for more than a year now. But some “ad-like” remnants that had value in the past are now less aligned with Medium’s model of using subscriptions and a metered paywall to provide the best quality user experience. This means eliminating certain features that are superficially free, but for which you pay with attention.</p><p>So, as of September 1, 2018, our policies will include:</p><ul><li><strong>First-party promotion is allowed.</strong> You can promote your own work or goods and services you provide, like a link to your website or your book. For posts or publications run by a company (like company blogs), you can promote goods or services provided by your company.</li><li><strong>Third-party advertising and sponsorships are not allowed. </strong>You may not advertise or promote third-party products, services, or brands through Medium posts, publications, or letters. This includes images that indicate brand sponsorship in a post or letter, or as part of a publication name or logo.</li><li><strong>Images functioning as third-party ads are not allowed.</strong> Inline images or embeds that link out and function as banner ads for third-party brands will no longer be allowed.</li><li><strong>You must disclose affiliate links or payment for a post. </strong>Affiliate links, such as link out to Amazon with your code, or any other link out where you will receive a commission or other value, are allowed in posts. But, you must disclose somewhere in the post that it includes affiliate links. If you have received payment, goods or services, or something else of value in exchange for writing a post, you must still disclose this fact in writing within your post (as <a href=\\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking\\">FTC Rules and Guides</a>, and <a href=\\"https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4\\">Medium Rules</a> require).</li></ul><h3>Embedded Content</h3><p>Second, in preparing to comply with GDPR (the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation), it led us to step back, take a fresh look at our privacy practices, and renew our efforts to make Medium trustworthy. It raised questions about what types of data collection we should and should not allow through Medium. And in other cases, it led us to think about how to channel third-party data collection on Medium to make sure our users understand as clearly as possible what information about them is captured, by whom, where it winds up, and how it might be used.</p><p>As of September 1, 2018:</p><ul><li>Embeds that directly collect data through form fields will no longer be allowed.</li></ul><p>This includes embeds that facilitate the submission of email addresses and other personally identifying information through forms (such as Upscribe or Rabbut) and the submission of credit card information (such as Gumroad). We understand that this might make life harder for writers and publications who want to collect information directly from users. But, we believe this change is necessary to ensure that Medium readers know where their data is going and how it will be used.</p><p>Going forward, if you want to collect information from your users, you will need to link out from your post on Medium to a form hosted elsewhere that makes it clear to a user that they are no longer in the Medium network. We are working with Upscribe, Rabbut, and Gumroad so that their services function in line with these Medium policies.</p><p>We will continue to allow embeds that display content, such as YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, GitHub, and others, as explained in our <a href=\\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214981378-Embeds\\">Help Center</a>. Our <a href=\\"https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9\\">Privacy Policy</a> discusses in more detail how we treat this type of embed.</p><p>Thank you. We’re grateful for your continued use of Medium and appreciate your working with us to make Medium a place for thoughtful, high-quality stories.</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=aeee8ef5dacf\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/ad-free-medium-aeee8ef5dacf\\">Ad-Free Medium</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Both changes are designed to reduce trade-offs for writers: Writers no longer have to choose between earning money and submitting their story to a publication, and writers no longer have to worry about their fans not being able to read their work because of our metered paywall.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5TBstrwpQEOfhcwnRSqA9A.png\\" /></figure><h4><strong>Partner Program stories can now appear in publications</strong></h4><p>First, we’ve removed the limitation that writers could not add Partner Program stories to publications on Medium. Now, all stories — whether in a publication or not — can be published behind the metered paywall and stand to earn money.</p><p>How do you do this? If you’re enrolled in the Partner Program, when editing your story, select that “Yes,” you would like to make your story eligible to earn money from the menu in the editor.</p><p>For more information — whether you’re an owner of a publication or a writer — read our <a href=\\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005910834\\">FAQ</a>.</p><h4><strong>All Partner Program stories get a Friend Link that bypasses the paywall</strong></h4><p>We are also rolling out a new feature to all Partner Program writers: Friend Links will give anyone free access to your metered story, even if they’re not a subscribing <a href=\\"http://medium.com/membership\\">Medium member</a> and have read their complimentary stories for the month. You can share a Friend Link directly or on any social media platform, and anyone who views your story through that link gets complete access with no restrictions. And, you’ll still get paid based on member engagement with your stories.</p><p>To get the Friend Link, simply go to the published story and click or tap “Share with friends” at the top left of the page. (This works for stories in publications, too — the link is at the top right of the page.)</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aV5oi8ormsvEX3nHKEBdhA.png\\" /></figure><p>Learn more about Friend Links in <a href=\\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006543813\\">our FAQ</a>. Happy sharing!</p><h4><strong>About the Medium Partner Program</strong></h4><p>We launched the Medium Partner Program in October 2017 to reward writers for their work. Any writer can join the program, publish stories behind our metered paywall, and earn money based on the value their stories provide readers, not advertisers.

Anyone can write a piece on Medium and, as long as it’s not in violation of our <a href=\\"https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4\\">rules</a>, have the potential to find an audience. We celebrate diverse voices and believe that good stories can come from anywhere.</p><p>We also care about quality. We want you to put your best work on Medium, and we regularly feature stories we think are great. To help you understand what we mean when we say “quality,” we’ve written up these guidelines. They are based on what we know works best for readers — which means they should work well for you, too.</p><ul><li>Write a clear headline. Readers have a split second to decide if they want to read your piece. Put a good, descriptive title and subtitle on your story. (Standard “headline” styling is title case for the headline and sentence case for the subtitle. This isn’t mandatory, but it’s ideal.)</li><li>Your story should contain original insight, ideas or perspectives. Don’t just aggregate the work of others, and don’t plagiarize.</li><li>Clean it up. We all make mistakes, but do look out for typos and janky formatting. Put care into your work.</li><li>Avoid CTAs. Readers tell us that they find repeated calls to action — to sign up for a newsletter, to clap — annoying. Consider eliminating CTAs altogether.</li><li>One of the things our readers like best about Medium is that it’s an ad-free zone.</li><li>Please don’t publish stories with the primary purpose of selling a product or a service. Readers can see through content marketing.</li><li>There are a lot of places on the Internet for clickbait. Medium doesn’t want to be one of them.</li><li>Put a nice image on your story — just make sure you’re not violating someone else’s copyright.</li><li>Finally, please don’t peddle pseudoscience or bad health advice. Life’s already too short to give people bad health advice.</li></ul><p>In short, do your best work. People like to read things that are just <em>good</em>.</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=386506ae62b9\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/best-practices-for-writing-on-medium-386506ae62b9\\">Best Practices for Writing On Medium</a> was originally published in <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com\\">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Illustrations: <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/e69f0c6dab7a\\">katie zhu</a></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, we released the <a href=\\"https://medium.com/s/playback/roxane-gay-what-fullness-is-8efc5cab3daf\\">first episode</a> of our first podcast, Medium Playback. On each episode of the show, we invite a writer we love to the studio to perform a recent story they wrote for Medium (episode one features beloved author <a href=\\"https://medium.com/u/d5f6a126e0de\\">Roxane Gay</a>) and then chat with us about it.</p><p>To make the show work, we were looking for hosts to introduce you to each episode’s guest and have a candid conversation with them about the story.

Why Playback?</h4><p>Kara: There are so many stories out there that you rarely get to do a deep dive. In this age when you have all of this content and all this work being done, it’s nice to actually take a second to learn more about the things we enjoy.</p><h4>So it’s another chance — and a different way — to get a story in front of people.</h4><p>Manoush: <em>Playback</em> isn’t just to introduce people to new stories but also to experience it again in a different way. We take in so much information on screens all day long. So as a journalist who makes podcasts , I really appreciate the power of voice. To hear someone read their words. What do they emphasize? What emotions do they imbue in the words they’ve so carefully crafted? The way someone says something can really impart so much emotional information.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ga2cr_Q2lb7JKFEGXDYM7g.png\\" /></figure><h4>Can you think of an example from any of the episodes where, in hearing the story, there was an emotion or nuance that was unexpected?</h4><p>Kara: I find Roxane Gay’s voice so distinctive, so I like to hear everything she writes in her own voice anyway. But really hearing her go through that journey via her own reading made it even more powerful.</p><h4>I had a similar experience with Roxane’s episode. Somehow the frankness with which she writes feels less frank and more emotional when you hear it.</h4><p>Manoush: Baratunde Thurston’s a comedian, so when he says just one sentence you think, “Oh, I didn’t realize that was funny until I heard you say it.” In contrast, designer Mike Monteiro, who never has his voice out there, was equally powerful. He relaxed into the words he’d written and became passionate all over again about design and the ethical ways that we build our technology.</p><h4>What do you think you can do with a podcast that you can’t do with your own writing?</h4><p>Manoush: I do not feel as comfortable with longform writing. I wrote a book but it was painful. I really struggled. But I’ve been doing taped conversation and broadcast media for over 20 years and I just love it. I love that you can say a very short sentence but because of the way you say it, you can convey all kinds of meaning. Maybe that says I’m lazy. I’m not sure.</p><p>Kara: When I was at <em>Jezebel</em>, because of the nature of the site, people felt very connected to what I was writing. With podcasts it’s even more so and I’ve had to adjust. On <em>Keep It</em>, I’m in people’s ears when they’re driving to work or folding laundry. It’s very intimate. I was surprised by people’s reactions to it and how excited they were to meet me. At a live show people were running up to the stage, and I remember thinking, “Guys, calm down, it’s a podcast.”</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UYZse7a8K6n-Dsug\\" /></figure><h4>Manoush, your work focuses on how technology impacts in our lives. I’m curious about your conversation with Baratunde about his data detox.</h4><p>Manoush: I had done a project in January 2017 called <em>The Privacy Paradox</em> , where we got 50,000 people to do a weeklong bootcamp to investigate where their personal data is. I put so much work into this and been shouting about this for so long, but I wasn’t sure if there would be any change.</p><p>When the Facebook story broke, this became a mainstream conversation in America. It was really a relief. So to hear Baratunde take all that has happened over the past year and to codify it into this beautiful long piece felt very satisfying.</p><p><strong>Kara, you wear many hats: you wrote for <em>Grown-ish</em>, Shondaland, and have a blog, </strong><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fancypastabitch.com%2F\\"><strong>Fancy Pasta Bitch</strong></a><strong>. Tell us a bit more about that project.</strong></p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*ZGBoOmuDhVXmbkeV\\" /></figure><p>Kara: The pasta blog is the silliest thing I do and it seems to elicit the greatest response. I bought a pasta machine around March of 2017, kind of in response to Trump being President. I wanted a hobby to take my mind off things. I made pasta one night and it was so good — I couldn’t believe I had made that. I thought, “This could be in a restaurant, I’m amazing. I’m a fancy pasta bitch!” I put it on Instagram and my friend Amina from the podcast <em>Call Your Girlfriend </em>messaged me, “You have to buy that URL.” And I had been drinking wine, so I went to Google and bought it for $15. I’m working on a new show called <em>In The Dark</em>. It’s a drama for the CW, so I’m trying to be a very dramatic person. So it’s nice to have the blog as an outlet for my dumbest jokes.</p><h4>Let’s do a lightning round. What’s the best book you’ve read so far this year?</h4><p>Kara: <em>The Truth about Animals</em> by Lucy Cooke. It’s all of this insane information about animals and really weird things that they do. We don’t know how eels have sex. It’s crazy.</p><p>Manoush: I just started reading my friend, Elizabeth Wallace’s new book, <em>The Ambition Decisions</em>, which isn’t even out yet. It’s about 40 women my age, my economic bracket, and what has happened to them in the last 20 years.</p><h4>What time of day do you do your best writing?</h4><p>Kara: My best writing unfortunately is around 11:30 p.m.</p><p>Manoush: In the late afternoon or evening. I wish it was at five in the morning but my brain doesn’t function.</p><h4>Favorite guilty pleasure TV show?</h4><p>Kara: Literally every <em>Real Housewives</em> franchise, although I don’t feel guilty about it.</p><p>Manoush: <em>High Maintenance</em>, also don’t feel guilty.</p><h4>What’s the most overrated aspect of summer?</h4><p>Kara: The beach in L.A. Give me a pool any day.</p><p>Manoush: Iced coffee. I think cafes are keeping old coffee around and icing it.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XeRHPGmcawfOzWz9\\" /></figure><h4>Who on Twitter should we be following?</h4><p>Kara: <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwordscience\\">Samantha Irby</a> and a young writer, <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fgeekylonglegs\\">Sarah Hagi</a>. If I ever have a TV show I’m immediately hiring her.</p><p>Manoush: <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FNeinQuarterly\\">Nein Quarterly</a>. It’s German humor that’s not that funny and kind of negative.</p><h4>What song or album do you have on repeat?</h4><p>Kara: Cardi B’s new album. I have been a Cardi-Believer since the early days. I think everyone thought her album wouldn’t be good and it is and I’m very proud of her.</p><p>Manoush: <em>Why Do You Always Call Me When You’re High?</em> by the Arctic Monkeys. Because it reminds me of when I was 23.</p><h4>What’s your favorite word in the English language?</h4><p>Kara: “Persnickety.”</p><p>Manoush: My ten year old and I think “dormant” is so good because there’s a lot of promise there, it just hasn’t come yet.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*DcJ9y_Us5YeBuiJd\\" /></figure><p>Listen to <a href=\\"https://medium.com/@playback\\">Medium Playback</a> on <a href=\\"http://medium.com/playback\\">Medium</a>, <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmedium-playback%2Fid1394390142\\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fmusic%2Flisten%3Fu%3D0%23%2Fps%2FIvnwjgyhf6wm55wnn6orrv2joke\\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fshow%2F48D69V7ZL38UOCKe6Uepyv%3Fsi%3D-bDlvTHbRei87ja8rZI5jw\\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\\"https://pca.st/c9nz\\">Pocket Casts</a>, or wherever you listen to your podcasts.</p><img src=\\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dfceca24042\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\"><hr><p><a href=\\"https://blog.medium.com/we-have-a-podcast-meet-the-hosts-dfceca24042\\">We Have a Podcast!

          "value": "<p>Some technical debt is in plain sight.</p>
<p>An inadequate data structure might lead to convoluted code. When the requirements keep changing, the code might contain traces of previous approaches. Sometimes the code is written in a hurry or is just sloppy.</p>
<p>This kind of technical debt is easy to discuss because it’s highly visible. It manifests as bugs, performance problems, and difficulties adding features.</p>
<p>There is another, more insidious kind of technical debt.</p>
<p>Maybe the test suite is a <em>little bit</em> slow. Not slow to a crawl — but just enough that you don’t bother looking at a bug and add it to the backlog instead. Maybe you don’t trust the deployment script so you skip that extra release. Perhaps the abstraction layers make it too hard to locate a performance regression so you leave a TODO in the code. Sometimes the unit tests are too rigid so you postpone trying an intriguing new idea until after you’ve shipped the planned features.</p>
<p>None of these things are dealbreakers. If anything, they might seem like distractions. It feels vain to complain about them. After all, if they <em>really</em> mattered, you would have done those things despite the friction, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>And so these things never get done. They don’t seem important enough by themselves. <strong>The friction killed them.</strong> Some of these explorations could be of no consequence. Some of them could redefine your project.</p>
<p>You never know. This is why you must actively reduce friction. Like your project’s fate depends on it. Because it does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve had a lot of people point to setInterval with hooks as some sort of egg on React’s face</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I think these people have a point. It <em>is</em> confusing at first.</p>
<p>But I’ve also come to see it not as a flaw of Hooks but as a mismatch between the <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/\\">React programming model</a> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code>. Hooks, being closer to the React programming model than classes, make that mismatch more prominent.</p>
<p><strong>There <em>is</em> a way to get them working together very well but it’s a bit unintuitive.</strong></p>
<p>In this post, we’ll look at <em>how</em> to make intervals and Hooks play well together, <em>why</em> this solution makes sense, and which <em>new</em> capabilities it can give you.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: this post focuses on a <em>pathological case</em>. Even if an API simplifies a hundred use cases, the discussion will always focus on the one that got harder.</strong></p>

<p>Dan, this code doesn’t make any sense. What happened to “Just JavaScript”? Admit that React has jumped the shark with Hooks!</p>

<p><strong>I thought this too but I changed my mind, and I’m going to change yours.</strong> Before explaining why this code makes sense, I want to show off what it can do.</p>

<p>To remind you, my <code class=\\"language-text\\">useInterval</code> Hook accepts a function and a delay:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">useInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token number\\">1000</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This looks a lot like <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code>:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">setInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token number\\">1000</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>So why not just use <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> directly?</strong></p>
<p>This may not be obvious at first, but the difference between the <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> you know and my <code class=\\"language-text\\">useInterval</code> Hook is that <strong>its arguments are “dynamic”</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ll illustrate this point with a concrete example.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s say we want the interval delay to be adjustable:</p>
<p><img src=\\"https://overreacted.io/counter_delay-35e4f35a8585255b11c090aed9f72433.gif\\" alt=\\"Counter with an input that adjusts the interval delay\\"></p>
<p>While you wouldn’t necessarily control the delay with an <em>input</em>, adjusting it dynamically can be useful — for example, to poll for some AJAX updates less often while the user has switched to a different tab.</p>
<p>So how would you do this with <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> in a class? I ended up with this:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">class</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Counter</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">extends</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">React<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>When <code class=\\"language-text\\">useInterval</code> Hook sees a different delay, it sets up the interval again.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of writing code to <em>set</em> and <em>clear</em> the interval, I can <em>declare</em> an interval with a particular delay — and our <code class=\\"language-text\\">useInterval</code> Hook makes it happen.</strong></p>

<p>This is what gets me excited about Hooks and React all over again. We can wrap the existing imperative APIs and create declarative APIs expressing our intent more closely. Just like with rendering, we can <strong>describe the process at all points in time simultaneously</strong> instead of carefully issuing commands to manipulate it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope by this you’re sold on <code class=\\"language-text\\">useInterval()</code> Hook being a nicer API — at least when we’re doing it from a component.</p>
<p><strong>But why is using <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval()</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">clearInterval()</code> annoying with Hooks?</strong> Let’s go back to our counter example and try to implement it manually.</p>

<p><em>(See the <a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/7wlxk1k87j\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">CodeSandbox demo</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Seems easy enough? This kind of works.</p>
<p><strong>However, this code has a strange behavior.</strong></p>
<p>React by default re-applies effects after every render. This is intentional and helps avoid <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#explanation-why-effects-run-on-each-update\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">a whole class of bugs</a> that are present in React class components.</p>
<p>This is usually good because many subscription APIs can happily remove the old and add a new listener at any time. However, <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> isn’t one of them. When we run <code class=\\"language-text\\">clearInterval</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code>, their timing shifts. If we re-render and re-apply effects too often, the interval never gets a chance to fire!</p>
<p>We can see the bug by re-rendering our component within a <em>smaller</em> interval:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token function\\">setInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>You might know that <code class=\\"language-text\\">useEffect()</code> lets us <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><em>opt out</em></a> of re-applying effects. You can specify a dependency array as a second argument, and React will only re-run the effect if something in that array changes:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>When we want to <em>only</em> run the effect on mount and cleanup on unmount, we can pass an empty <code class=\\"language-text\\">[]</code> array of dependencies.</p>
<p>However, this is a common source of mistakes if you’re not very familiar with JavaScript closures. We’re going to make this mistake right now! (We’re also building a <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14636\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">lint rule</a> to surface these bugs early but it’s not quite ready yet.)</p>
<p>In the first attempt, our problem was that re-running the effects caused our timer to get cleared too early. We can try to fix it by never re-running them:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Counter</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>However, now our counter updates to 1 and stays there. (<a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/jj0mk6y683\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">See the bug in action</a>.)</p>
<p>What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>The problem is that <code class=\\"language-text\\">useEffect</code> captures the <code class=\\"language-text\\">count</code> from the first render.</strong> It is equal to <code class=\\"language-text\\">0</code>. We never re-apply the effect so the closure in <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> always references the <code class=\\"language-text\\">count</code> from the first render, and <code class=\\"language-text\\">count + 1</code> is always <code class=\\"language-text\\">1</code>. Oops!</p>
<p><strong>I can hear your teeth grinding. Hooks are so annoying, right?</strong></p>
<p><a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/j379jxrzjy\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">One way</a> to fix it is to replace <code class=\\"language-text\\">setCount(count + 1)</code> with the “updater” form like <code class=\\"language-text\\">setCount(c =&gt; c + 1)</code>. It can always reads fresh state for that variable. But this doesn’t help you read the fresh props, for example.</p>
<p><a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/00o9o95jyv\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Another fix</a> is to <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useReducer()</code></a>. This approach gives you more flexibility. Inside the reducer, you have the access both to current state and fresh props. The <code class=\\"language-text\\">dispatch</code> function itself never changes so you can pump data into it from any closure. One limitation of <code class=\\"language-text\\">useReducer()</code> is that you can’t yet emit side effects in it. (However, you could return new state — triggering some effect.)</p>
<p><strong>But why is it getting so convoluted?</strong></p>

<p>This term is sometimes thrown around, and <a href=\\"https://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/15/impedance-mismatch.aspx/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Phil Haack</a> explains it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might say Databases are from Mars and Objects are from Venus. Databases do not map naturally to object models. It’s a lot like trying to push the north poles of two magnets together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our “impedance mismatch” is not between Databases and Objects. It is between the React programming model and the imperative <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> API.</p>
<p><strong>A React component may be mounted for a while and go through many different states, but its render result describes <em>all of them at once.</em></strong></p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Describes every render</span>

<p>Hooks let us apply the same declarative approach to effects:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Describes every interval state</span>
  <span class=\\"token function\\">useInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>We don’t <em>set</em> the interval, but specify <em>whether</em> it is set and with what delay. Our Hook makes it happen. A continuous process is described in discrete terms.</p>
<p><strong>By contrast, <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> does not describe a process in time — once you set the interval, you can’t change anything about it except clearing it.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the mismatch between the React model and the <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval</code> API.</p>
<hr>
<p>Props and state of React components can change. React will re-render them and “forget” everything about the previous render result. It becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>The <code class=\\"language-text\\">useEffect()</code> Hook “forgets” the previous render too. It cleans up the last effect and sets up the next effect. The next effect closes over fresh props and state. This is why our <a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/7wlxk1k87j\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">first attempt</a> worked for simple cases.</p>
<p><strong>But <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval()</code> does not “forget”.</strong> It will forever reference the old props and state until you replace it — which you can’t do without resetting the time.</p>

<p>The problem boils down to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval(callback1, delay)</code> with <code class=\\"language-text\\">callback1</code> from first render.</li>
<li>We have <code class=\\"language-text\\">callback2</code> from next render that closes over fresh props and state.</li>
<li>But we can’t replace an already existing interval without resetting the time!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So what if we didn’t replace the interval at all, and instead introduced a mutable <code class=\\"language-text\\">savedCallback</code> variable pointing to the <em>latest</em> interval callback?</strong></p>
<p>Now we can see the solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval(fn, delay)</code> where <code class=\\"language-text\\">fn</code> calls <code class=\\"language-text\\">savedCallback</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code class=\\"language-text\\">savedCallback</code> to <code class=\\"language-text\\">callback1</code> after the first render.</li>
<li>Set <code class=\\"language-text\\">savedCallback</code> to <code class=\\"language-text\\">callback2</code> after the next render.</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>PROFIT</li>
</ul>
<p>This mutable <code class=\\"language-text\\">savedCallback</code> needs to “persist” across the re-renders. So it can’t be a regular variable. We want something more like an instance field.</p>
<p><a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-instance-variables\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">As we can learn from the Hooks FAQ,</a> <code class=\\"language-text\\">useRef()</code> gives us exactly that:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> savedCallback <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useRef</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// { current: null }</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>(You might be familiar with <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">DOM refs</a> in React. Hooks use the same concept for holding any mutable values. A ref is like a “box” into which you can put anything.)</em></p>
<p><code class=\\"language-text\\">useRef()</code> returns a plain object with a mutable <code class=\\"language-text\\">current</code> property that’s shared between renders. We can save the <em>latest</em> interval callback into it:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">callback</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Can read fresh props, state, etc.</span>
    <span class=\\"token function\\">setCount</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>count <span class=\\"token operator\\">+</span> <span class=\\"token number\\">1</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>

  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// After every render, save the latest callback into our ref.</span>
  <span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
<span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">    savedCallback<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>current <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> callback<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span>  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then we can read and call it from inside our interval:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> id <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">setInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>tick<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token number\\">1000</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token function\\">clearInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>id<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to <code class=\\"language-text\\">[]</code>, our effect never re-executes, and the interval doesn’t get reset. However, thanks to the <code class=\\"language-text\\">savedCallback</code> ref, we can always read the callback that we set after the last render, and call it from the interval tick.</p>
<p>Here’s a complete working solution:</p>

<p>Admittedly, the above code can be disorienting. It’s mind-bending to mix the opposite paradigms. There’s also a potential to make a mess with mutable refs.</p>
<p><strong>I think Hooks provide lower-level primitives than classes — but their beauty is that they enable us to compose and create better declarative abstractions.</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, I just want to write this:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"js\\"><pre class=\\"language-js\\"><code class=\\"language-js\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Counter</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I’ll copy and paste the body of my ref mechanism into a custom Hook:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>callback<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> id <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">setInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>tick<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token number\\">1000</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Currently, the <code class=\\"language-text\\">1000</code> delay is hardcoded. I want to make it an argument:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>callback<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> delay<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I will use it when I set up the interval:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> id <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">setInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>tick<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> delay<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p> Now that the <code class=\\"language-text\\">delay</code> can change between renders, I need to declare it in the dependencies of my interval effect:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"js\\"><pre class=\\"language-js\\"><code class=\\"language-js\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

    <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>

    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> id <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">setInterval</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>tick<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> delay<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

<p>Wait, didn’t we want to avoid resetting the interval effect, and specifically passed <code class=\\"language-text\\">[]</code> to avoid it? Not quite. We only wanted to avoid resetting it when the <em>callback</em> changes. But when the <code class=\\"language-text\\">delay</code> changes, we <em>want</em> to restart the timer!</p>
<p>Let’s check if our code works:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Counter</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>Say we want to be able to pause our interval by passing <code class=\\"language-text\\">null</code> as the <code class=\\"language-text\\">delay</code>:</p>

<p>How do we implement this? The answer is: by not setting up an interval.</p>

<p>That’s it. This code handles all possible transitions: a change of a delay, pausing, or resuming an interval. The <code class=\\"language-text\\">useEffect()</code> API asks us to spend more upfront effort to describe the setup and cleanup — but adding new cases is easy.</p>

<p>This <code class=\\"language-text\\">useInterval()</code> Hook is really fun to play with. When the side effects are declarative, it’s much easier to orchestrate complex behaviors together.</p>

<p>Hooks take some getting used to — and <em>especially</em> at the boundary of imperative and declarative code. You can create powerful declarative abstractions with them like <a href=\\"http://react-spring.surge.sh/hooks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">React Spring</a> but they can definitely get on your nerves sometimes.</p>
<p>This is an early time for Hooks, and there are definitely still patterns we need to work out and compare. Don’t rush to adopt Hooks if you’re used to following well-known “best practices”. There’s still a lot to try and discover.</p>
<p>I hope this post helps you understand the common pitfalls related to using APIs like <code class=\\"language-text\\">setInterval()</code> with Hooks, the patterns that can help you overcome them, and the sweet fruit of creating more expressive declarative APIs on top of them.</p>

<p>I’ve written about the challenges of creating <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/\\">user interfaces</a> before. But this post talks about React in a different way — more as a <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">programming runtime</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This post won’t teach you anything about creating user interfaces.</strong> But it might help you understand the React programming model in more depth.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note: If you’re <em>learning</em> React, check out <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">the docs</a> instead.</strong></p>
<p><font size=\\"60\\">⚠️</font></p>
<p><strong>This is a deep dive — THIS IS NOT a beginner-friendly post.</strong> In this post, I’m describing most of the React programming model from first principles. I don’t explain how to use it — just how it works.</p>
<p>It’s aimed at experienced programmers and folks working on other UI libraries who asked about some tradeoffs chosen in React. I hope you’ll find it useful!</p>
<p><strong>Many people successfully use React for years without thinking about most of these topics.</strong> This is definitely a programmer-centric view of React rather than, say, a <a href=\\"http://mrmrs.cc/writing/2016/04/21/developing-ui/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">designer-centric one</a>. But I don’t think it hurts to have resources for both.</p>

<p>Some programs output numbers. Other programs output poems. Different languages and their runtimes are often optimized for a particular set of use cases, and React is no exception to that.</p>
<p>React programs usually output <strong>a tree that may change over time</strong>. It might be a <a href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">DOM tree</a>, an <a href=\\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/View%20Hierarchy.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">iOS hierarchy</a>, a tree of <a href=\\"https://react-pdf.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">PDF primitives</a>, or even of <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">JSON objects</a>. However, usually, we want to represent some UI with it. We’ll call it a “<em>host</em> tree” because it is a part of the <em>host environment</em> outside of React — like DOM or iOS. The host tree usually has <a href=\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">its</a> <a href=\\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622616-addsubview\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">own</a> imperative API. React is a layer on top of it.</p>
<p>So what is React useful for? Very abstractly, it helps you write a program that predictably manipulates a complex host tree in response to external events like interactions, network responses, timers, and so on.</p>
<p>A specialized tool works better than a generic one when it can impose and benefit from particular constraints. React makes a bet on two principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability.</strong> The host tree is relatively stable and most updates don’t radically change its overall structure. If an app rearranged all its interactive elements into a completely different combination every second, it would be difficult to use. Where did that button go? Why is my screen dancing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regularity.</strong> The host tree can be broken down into UI patterns that look and behave consistently (such as buttons, lists, avatars) rather than random shapes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These principles happen to be true for most UIs.</strong> However, React is ill-suited when there are no stable “patterns” in the output. For example, React may help you write a Twitter client but won’t be very useful for a <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzx9ArZ7MUU\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">3D pipes screensaver</a>.</p>

<p>The host tree consists of nodes. We’ll call them “host instances”.</p>
<p>In the DOM environment, host instances are regular DOM nodes — like the objects you get when you call <code class=\\"language-text\\">document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;)</code>. On iOS, host instances could be values uniquely identifying a native view from JavaScript.</p>
<p>Host instances have their own properties (e.g. <code class=\\"language-text\\">domNode.className</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">view.tintColor</code>). They may also contain other host instances as children.</p>
<p>(This has nothing to do with React — I’m describing the host environments.)</p>
<p>There is usually an API to manipulate host instances. For example, the DOM provides APIs like <code class=\\"language-text\\">appendChild</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">removeChild</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">setAttribute</code>, and so on. In React apps, you usually don’t call these APIs. That’s the job of React.</p>

<p>A <em>renderer</em> teaches React to talk to a specific host environment and manage its host instances. React DOM, React Native, and even <a href=\\"https://mobile.twitter.com/vadimdemedes/status/1089344289102942211\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Ink</a> are React renderers. You can also <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-reconciler\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">create your own React renderer</a>.</p>
<p>React renderers can work in one of two modes.</p>
<p>The vast majority of renderers are written to use the “mutating” mode. This mode is how the DOM works: we can create a node, set its properties, and later add or remove children from it. The host instances are completely mutable.</p>
<p>React can also work in a “persistent” mode. This mode is for host environments that don’t provide methods like <code class=\\"language-text\\">appendChild()</code> but instead clone the parent tree and always replace the top-level child. Immutability on the host tree level makes multi-threading easier. <a href=\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">React Fabric</a> takes advantage of that.</p>
<p>As a React user, you never need to think about these modes. I only want to highlight that React isn’t just an adapter from one mode to another. Its usefulness is orthogonal to the target low-level view API paradigm.</p>

<p>In the host environment, a host instance (like a DOM node) is the smallest building block. In React, the smallest building block is a <em>React element</em>.</p>
<p>A React element is a plain JavaScript object. It can <em>describe</em> a host instance.</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// JSX is a syntax sugar for these objects.</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// &lt;button className=\\"blue\\" /></span>

<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A React element is lightweight and has no host instance tied to it. Again, it is merely a <em>description</em> of what you want to see on the screen.</p>
<p>Like host instances, React elements can form a tree:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// JSX is a syntax sugar for these objects.</span>

<p><em>(Note: I omitted <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/why-do-react-elements-have-typeof-property/\\">some properties</a> that aren’t important to this explanation.)</em></p>
<p>However, remember that <strong>React elements don’t have their own persistent identity.</strong> They’re meant to be re-created and thrown away all the time.</p>
<p>React elements are immutable. For example, you can’t change the children or a property of a React element. If you want to render something different later, you will <em>describe</em> it with a new React element tree created from scratch.</p>
<p>I like to think of React elements as being like frames in a movie. They capture what the UI should look like at a specific point in time. They don’t change.</p>

<p>Each React renderer has an “entry point”. It’s the API that lets us tell React to render a particular React element tree inside a container host instance.</p>
<p>For example, React DOM entry point is <code class=\\"language-text\\">ReactDOM.render</code>:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">ReactDOM<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">render</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// { type: 'button', props: { className: 'blue' } }</span>
  <span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\\"token attr-name\\">className</span><span class=\\"token attr-value\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">=</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">\\"</span>blue<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">\\"</span></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">/></span></span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span>
  document<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">getElementById</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token string\\">'container'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we say <code class=\\"language-text\\">ReactDOM.render(reactElement, domContainer)</code>, we mean: <strong>“Dear React, make the <code class=\\"language-text\\">domContainer</code> host tree match my <code class=\\"language-text\\">reactElement</code>.”</strong></p>
<p>React will look at the <code class=\\"language-text\\">reactElement.type</code> (in our example, <code class=\\"language-text\\">&#39;button&#39;</code>) and ask the React DOM renderer to create a host instance for it and set the properties:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Somewhere in the ReactDOM renderer (simplified)</span>
<span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">createHostInstance</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>reactElement<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
<span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> domNode <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> document<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">createElement</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>reactElement<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>type<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span><span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">  domNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>className <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> reactElement<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>className<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span>  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> domNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our example, effectively React will do this:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> domNode <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> document<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">createElement</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token string\\">'button'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span><span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">domNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>className <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">'blue'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span>

<p>If the React element has child elements in <code class=\\"language-text\\">reactElement.props.children</code>, React will recursively create host instances for them too on the first render.</p>

<p>Again, React’s job is to <em>make the host tree match the provided React element tree</em>. The process of figuring out <em>what</em> to do to the host instance tree in response to new information is sometimes called <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">reconciliation</a>.</p>
<p>There are two ways to go about it. A simplified version of React could blow away the existing tree and re-create it from scratch:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> domContainer <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> document<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">getElementById</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token string\\">'container'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// Clear the tree</span>
domContainer<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>innerHTML <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">''</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// Create the new host instance tree</span>
<span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> domNode <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> document<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">createElement</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token string\\">'button'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
domNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>className <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">'red'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
domContainer<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">appendChild</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>domNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But in DOM, this is slow and loses important information like focus, selection, scroll state, and so on. Instead, we want React to do something like this:</p>

<p>In other words, React needs to decide when to <em>update</em> an existing host instance to match a new React element, and when to create a <em>new</em> one.</p>
<p>This raises a question of <em>identity</em>. The React element may be different every time, but when does it refer to the same host instance conceptually?</p>
<p>In our example, it’s simple. We used to render a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;button&gt;</code> as a first (and only) child, and we want to render a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;button&gt;</code> in the same place again. We already have a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;button&gt;</code> host instance there so why re-create it? Let’s just reuse it.</p>
<p>This is pretty close to how React thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>If an element type in the same place in the tree “matches up” between the previous and the next renders, React reuses the existing host instance.</strong></p>
<p>Here is an example with comments showing roughly what React does:</p>

<p>The same heuristic is used for child trees. For example, when we update a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;dialog&gt;</code> with two <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;button&gt;</code>s inside, React first decides whether to re-use the <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;dialog&gt;</code>, and then repeats this decision procedure for each child.</p>

<p>If React only reuses host instances when the element types “match up” between updates, how can we render conditional content?</p>
<p>Say we want to first show only an input, but later render a message before it:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// First render</span>

<p>In this example, the <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;input&gt;</code> host instance would get re-created. React would walk the element tree, comparing it with the previous version:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code class=\\"language-text\\">dialog → dialog</code>: Can reuse the host instance? <strong>Yes — the type matches.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class=\\"language-text\\">input → p</code>: Can reuse the host instance? <strong>No, the type has changed!</strong> Need to remove the existing <code class=\\"language-text\\">input</code> and create a new <code class=\\"language-text\\">p</code> host instance.</li>
<li><code class=\\"language-text\\">(nothing) → input</code>: Need to create a new <code class=\\"language-text\\">input</code> host instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So effectively the update code executed by React would be like:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> oldInputNode <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> dialogNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>firstChild<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span><span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">dialogNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">removeChild</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>oldInputNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span>

<p>This is not great because <em>conceptually</em> the <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;input&gt;</code> hasn’t been <em>replaced</em> with <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;p&gt;</code> — it just moved. We don’t want to lose its selection, focus state, and content due to re-creating the DOM.</p>
<p>While this problem has an easy fix (which we’ll get to in a minute), it doesn’t occur often in the React applications. It’s interesting to see why.</p>
<p>In practice, you would rarely call <code class=\\"language-text\\">ReactDOM.render</code> directly. Instead, React apps tend to be broken down into functions like this:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Form</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span> showMessage <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">if</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>showMessage<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>
    <span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;</span>dialog</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token plain-text\\">

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This example doesn’t suffer from the problem we just described. It might be easier to see why if we use object notation instead of JSX. Look at the <code class=\\"language-text\\">dialog</code> child element tree:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Form</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span> showMessage <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Regardless of whether <code class=\\"language-text\\">showMessage</code> is <code class=\\"language-text\\">true</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">false</code>, the <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;input&gt;</code> is the second child and doesn’t change its tree position between renders.</strong></p>
<p>If <code class=\\"language-text\\">showMessage</code> changes from <code class=\\"language-text\\">false</code> to <code class=\\"language-text\\">true</code>, React would walk the element tree, comparing it with the previous version:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code class=\\"language-text\\">dialog → dialog</code>: Can reuse the host instance? <strong>Yes — the type matches.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class=\\"language-text\\">(null) → p</code>: Need to insert a new <code class=\\"language-text\\">p</code> host instance.</li>
<li><code class=\\"language-text\\">input → input</code>: Can reuse the host instance? <strong>Yes — the type matches.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the code executed by React would be similar to this:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> inputNode <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> dialogNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>firstChild<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

<p>Comparing the element type at the same position in the tree is usually enough to decide whether to reuse or re-create the corresponding host instance.</p>
<p>But this only works well if child positions are static and don’t re-order. In our example above, even though <code class=\\"language-text\\">message</code> could be a “hole”, we still knew that the input goes after the message, and there are no other children.</p>
<p>With dynamic lists, we can’t be sure the order is ever the same:</p>

<p>If the <code class=\\"language-text\\">list</code> of our shopping items is ever re-ordered, React will see that all <code class=\\"language-text\\">p</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">input</code> elements inside have the same type, and won’t know to move them. (From React’s point of view, the <em>items themselves</em> changed, not their order.)</p>
<p>The code executed by React to re-order 10 items would be something like:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">for</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> i <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token number\\">0</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span> i <span class=\\"token operator\\">&lt;</span> <span class=\\"token number\\">10</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span> i<span class=\\"token operator\\">++</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> pNode <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> formNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>childNodes<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>i<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> textNode <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> pNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>firstChild<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  textNode<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>textContent <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">'You bought '</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">+</span> items<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>i<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>name<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So instead of <em>re-ordering</em> them, React would effectively <em>update</em> each of them. This can create performance issues and possible bugs. For example, the content of the first input would stay reflected in first input <em>after</em> the sort — even though conceptually they might refer to different products in your shopping list!</p>
<p><strong>This is why React nags you to specify a special property called <code class=\\"language-text\\">key</code> every time you include an array of elements in your output:</strong></p>

<p>A <code class=\\"language-text\\">key</code> tells React that it should consider an item to be <em>conceptually</em> the same even if it has different <em>positions</em> inside its parent element between renders.</p>
<p>When React sees <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;p key=&quot;42&quot;&gt;</code> inside a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;form&gt;</code>, it will check if the previous render also contained <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;p key=&quot;42&quot;&gt;</code> inside the same <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;form&gt;</code>. This works even if <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;form&gt;</code> children changed their order. React will reuse the previous host instance with the same key if it exists, and re-order the siblings accordingly.</p>
<p>Note that the <code class=\\"language-text\\">key</code> is only relevant within a particular parent React element, such as a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;form&gt;</code>. React won’t try to “match up” elements with the same keys between different parents. (React doesn’t have idiomatic support for moving a host instance between different parents without re-creating it.)</p>
<p>What’s a good value for a <code class=\\"language-text\\">key</code>? An easy way to answer this is to ask: <strong>when would <em>you</em> say an item is the “same” even if the order changed?</strong> For example, in our shopping list, the product ID uniquely identifies it between siblings.</p>

<p>They are called <em>components</em>. They let us create our own “toolbox” of buttons, avatars, comments, and so on. Components are the bread and butter of React.</p>
<p>Components take one argument — an object hash. It contains “props” (short for “properties”). Here, <code class=\\"language-text\\">showMessage</code> is a prop. They’re like named arguments.</p>

<p>We created <code class=\\"language-text\\">items</code> <em>while rendering</em> and no other component “saw” it so we can mutate it as much as we like before handing it off as part of the render result. There is no need to contort your code to avoid local mutation.</p>
<p>Similarly, lazy initialization is fine despite not being fully “pure”:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">ExpenseForm</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Continue rendering...</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As long as calling a component multiple times is safe and doesn’t affect the rendering of other components, React doesn’t care if it’s 100% pure in the strict FP sense of the word. <a href=\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077412/what-is-an-idempotent-operation\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Idempotence</a> is more important to React than purity.</p>
<p>That said, side effects that are directly visible to the user are not allowed in React components. In other words, merely <em>calling</em> a component function shouldn’t by itself produce a change on the screen.</p>

<p>How do we <em>use</em> components from other components? Components are functions so we <em>could</em> call them:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">let</span> reactElement <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Form</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span> showMessage<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">:</span> <span class=\\"token boolean\\">true</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

<p>However, this is <em>not</em> the idiomatic way to use components in the React runtime.</p>
<p>Instead, the idiomatic way to use a component is with the same mechanism we’ve already seen before — React elements. <strong>This means that you don’t directly call the component function, but instead let React later do it for you</strong>:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// { type: Form, props: { showMessage: true } }</span>

<p>And somewhere inside React, your component will be called:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Somewhere inside React</span>

<p>Component function names are by convention capitalized. When the JSX transform sees <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Form&gt;</code> rather than <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;form&gt;</code>, it makes the object <code class=\\"language-text\\">type</code> itself an identifier rather than a string:</p>

<p>There is no global registration mechanism — we literally refer to <code class=\\"language-text\\">Form</code> by name when typing <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Form /&gt;</code>. If <code class=\\"language-text\\">Form</code> doesn’t exist in local scope, you’ll see a JavaScript error just like you normally would with a bad variable name.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so what does React do when an element type is a function? It calls your component, and asks what element <em>that</em> component wants to render.</strong></p>
<p>This process continues recursively and is described in more detail <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">here</a>. In short, it looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You:</strong> <code class=\\"language-text\\">ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, domContainer)</code></li>

<p>This is why we say reconciliation is recursive. When React walks the element tree, it might meet an element whose <code class=\\"language-text\\">type</code> is a component. It will call it and keep descending down the tree of returned React elements. Eventually, we’ll run out of components, and React will know what to change in the host tree.</p>
<p>The same reconciliation rules we already discussed apply here too. If the <code class=\\"language-text\\">type</code> at the same position (as determined by index and optional <code class=\\"language-text\\">key</code>) changes, React will throw away the host instances inside, and re-create them.</p>

<p>You might be wondering: why don’t we just call components directly? Why write <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Form /&gt;</code> rather than <code class=\\"language-text\\">Form()</code>?</p>
<p><strong>React can do its job better if it “knows” about your components rather than if it only sees the React element tree after recursively calling them.</strong></p>

<p>This is a classic example of <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">inversion of control</a>. There’s a few interesting properties we get by letting React take control of calling our components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Components become more than functions.</strong> React can augment component functions with features like <em>local state</em> that are tied to the component identity in the tree. A good runtime provides fundamental abstractions that match the problem at hand. As we already mentioned, React is oriented specifically at programs that render UI trees and respond to interactions. If you called components directly, you’d have to build these features yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Component types participate in the reconciliation.</strong> By letting React call your components, you also tell it more about the conceptual structure of your tree. For example, when you move from rendering <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Feed&gt;</code> to the <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Profile&gt;</code> page, React won’t attempt to re-use host instances inside them — just like when you replace <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;button&gt;</code> with a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;p&gt;</code>. All state will be gone — which is usually good when you render a conceptually different view. You wouldn’t want to preserve input state between <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;PasswordForm&gt;</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;MessengerChat&gt;</code> even if the <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;input&gt;</code> position in the tree accidentally “lines up” between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>React can delay the reconciliation.</strong> If React takes control over calling our components, it can do many interesting things. For example, it can let the browser do some work between the component calls so that re-rendering a large component tree <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">doesn’t block the main thread</a>. Orchestrating this manually without reimplementing a large part of React is difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A better debugging story.</strong> If components are first-class citizens that the library is aware of, we can build <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">rich developer tools</a> for introspection in development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last benefit to React calling your component functions is <em>lazy evaluation</em>. Let’s see what this means.</p>
<h2 id=\\"lazy-evaluation\\"><a href=\\"#lazy-evaluation\\" aria-hidden class=\\"anchor\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\"true\\" height=\\"16\\" version=\\"1.1\\" viewBox=\\"0 0 16 16\\" width=\\"16\\"><path fill-rule=\\"evenodd\\" d=\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\"></path></svg></a>Lazy Evaluation</h2>
<p>When we call functions in JavaScript, arguments are evaluated before the call:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// (2) This gets computed second</span>
<span class=\\"token function\\">eat</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// (1) This gets computed first</span>
  <span class=\\"token function\\">prepareMeal</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is usually what JavaScript developers expect because JavaScript functions can have implicit side effects. It would be surprising if we called a function, but it wouldn’t execute until its result gets somehow “used” in JavaScript.</p>
<p>However, React components are <a href=\\"#purity\\">relatively</a> pure. There is absolutely no need to execute it if we know its result won’t get rendered on the screen.</p>
<p>Consider this component putting <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Comments&gt;</code> inside a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Page&gt;</code>:</p>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we called <code class=\\"language-text\\">Comments()</code> as a function, it would execute immediately regardless of whether <code class=\\"language-text\\">Page</code> wants to render them or not:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// {</span>

<p>But if we pass a React element, we don’t execute <code class=\\"language-text\\">Comments</code> ourselves at all:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// {</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">//   type: Page,</span>

<p>This lets React decide when and <em>whether</em> to call it. If our <code class=\\"language-text\\">Page</code> component ignores its <code class=\\"language-text\\">children</code> prop and renders
<code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;h1&gt;Please log in&lt;/h1&gt;</code> instead, React won’t even attempt to call the <code class=\\"language-text\\">Comments</code> function. What’s the point?</p>
<p>This is good because it both lets us avoid unnecessary rendering work that would be thrown away, and makes the code less fragile. (We don’t care if <code class=\\"language-text\\">Comments</code> throws or not when the user is logged out — it won’t be called.)</p>

<p>We talked <a href=\\"#reconciliation\\">earlier</a> about identity and how an element’s conceptual “position” in the tree tells React whether to re-use a host instance or create a new one. Host instances can have all kinds of local state: focus, selection, input, etc. We want to preserve this state between updates that conceptually render the same UI. We also want to predictably destroy it when we render something conceptually different (such as moving from <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;SignupForm&gt;</code> to <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;MessengerChat&gt;</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Local state is so useful that React lets <em>your own</em> components have it too.</strong> Components are still functions but React augments them with features that are useful for UIs. Local state tied to the position in the tree is one of these features.</p>
<p>We call these features <em>Hooks</em>. For example, <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState</code> is a Hook.</p>

<p>Even if we want to split the reconciliation process itself into <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDdgfyRB5kg\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">non-blocking</a> chunks of work, we should still perform the actual host tree operations in a single synchronous swoop. This way we can ensure that the user doesn’t see a half-updated UI, and that the browser doesn’t perform unnecessary layout and style recalculation for intermediate states that the user shouldn’t see.</p>
<p>This is why React splits all work into the “render phase” and the “commit phase”. <em>Render phase</em> is when React calls your components and performs reconciliation. It is safe to interrupt and <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">in the future</a> will be asynchronous. <em>Commit phase</em> is when React touches the host tree. It is always synchronous.</p>

<p>When a parent schedules an update by calling <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code>, by default React reconciles its whole child subtree. This is because React can’t know whether an update in the parent would affect the child or not, and by default, React opts to be consistent. This may sound very expensive but in practice, it’s not a problem for small and medium-sized subtrees.</p>
<p>When trees get too deep or wide, you can tell React to <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">memoize</a> a subtree and reuse previous render results during shallow equal prop changes:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Row</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span> item <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>

<span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">export</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">default</span> React<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">memo</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>Row<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> in a parent <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Table&gt;</code> component would skip over reconciling <code class=\\"language-text\\">Row</code>s whose <code class=\\"language-text\\">item</code> is referentially equal to the <code class=\\"language-text\\">item</code> rendered last time.</p>
<p>You can get fine-grained memoization at the level of individual expressions with the <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useMemo()</code> Hook</a>. The cache is local to component tree position and will be destroyed together with its local state. It only holds one last item.</p>
<p>React intentionally doesn’t memoize components by default. Many components always receive different props so memoizing them would be a net loss.</p>

<p>Ironically, React doesn’t use a “reactivity” system for fine-grained updates. In other words, any update at the top triggers reconciliation instead of updating just the components affected by changes.</p>
<p>This is an intentional design decision. <a href=\\"https://calibreapp.com/blog/time-to-interactive/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Time to interactive</a> is a crucial metric in consumer web applications, and traversing models to set up fine-grained listeners spends that precious time. Additionally, in many apps, interactions tend to result either in small (button hover) or large (page transition) updates, in which case fine-grained subscriptions are a waste of memory resources.</p>
<p>One of the core design principles of React is that it works with raw data. If you have a bunch of JavaScript objects received from the network, you can pump them directly into your components with no preprocessing. There are no gotchas about which properties you can access, or unexpected performance cliffs when a structure slightly changes. React rendering is O(<em>view size</em>) rather than O(<em>model size</em>), and you can significantly cut the <em>view size</em> with <a href=\\"https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/fixed-size\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">windowing</a>.</p>
<p>There are some kinds of applications where fine-grained subscriptions are beneficial — such as stock tickers. This is a rare example of “everything constantly updating at the same time”. While imperative escape hatches can help optimize such code, React might not be the best fit for this use case. Still, you can implement your own fine-grained subscription system on top of React.</p>
<p><strong>Note that there are common performance issues that even fine-grained subscriptions and “reactivity” systems can’t solve.</strong> For example, rendering a <em>new</em> deep tree (which happens on every page transition) without blocking the browser. Change tracking doesn’t make it faster — it makes it slower because we have to do more work to set up subscriptions. Another problem is that we have to wait for data before we can start rendering the view. In React, we aim to solve both of these problems with <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Concurrent Rendering</a>.</p>

<p>Several components may want to update state in response to the same event. This example is contrived but it illustrates a common pattern:</p>

<p>When an event is dispatched, the child’s <code class=\\"language-text\\">onClick</code> fires first (triggering its <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code>). Then the parent calls <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> in its own <code class=\\"language-text\\">onClick</code> handler.</p>
<p>If React immediately re-rendered components in response to <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> calls, we’d end up rendering the child twice:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token operator\\">**</span><span class=\\"token operator\\">*</span> Entering React's browser click event handler <span class=\\"token operator\\">**</span><span class=\\"token operator\\">*</span>

<p>The first <code class=\\"language-text\\">Child</code> render would be wasted. And we couldn’t make React skip rendering <code class=\\"language-text\\">Child</code> for the second time because the <code class=\\"language-text\\">Parent</code> might pass some different data to it based on its updated state.</p>
<p><strong>This is why React batches updates inside event handlers:</strong></p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token operator\\">**</span><span class=\\"token operator\\">*</span> Entering React's browser click event handler <span class=\\"token operator\\">**</span><span class=\\"token operator\\">*</span>

<p>The <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> calls in components wouldn’t immediately cause a re-render. Instead, React would execute all event handlers first, and then trigger a single re-render batching all of those updates together.</p>
<p>Batching is good for performance but can be surprising if you write code like:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>count<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> setCounter<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useState</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token number\\">0</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we start with <code class=\\"language-text\\">count</code> set to <code class=\\"language-text\\">0</code>, these would just be three <code class=\\"language-text\\">setCount(1)</code> calls. To fix this, <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> provides an overload that accepts an “updater” function:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>count<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> setCounter<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useState</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token number\\">0</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>React would put the updater functions in a queue, and later run them in sequence, resulting in a re-render with <code class=\\"language-text\\">count</code> set to <code class=\\"language-text\\">3</code>.</p>
<p>When state logic gets more complex than a few <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> calls, I recommend expressing it as a local state reducer with the <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useReducer</code> Hook</a>.

<p>A programming language runtime usually has a <a href=\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">call stack</a>. When a function <code class=\\"language-text\\">a()</code> calls <code class=\\"language-text\\">b()</code> which itself calls <code class=\\"language-text\\">c()</code>, somewhere in the JavaScript engine there’s a data structure like <code class=\\"language-text\\">[a, b, c]</code> that “keeps track” of where you are and what code to execute next. Once you exit out of <code class=\\"language-text\\">c</code>, its call stack frame is gone — poof! It’s not needed anymore. We jump back into <code class=\\"language-text\\">b</code>. By the time we exit <code class=\\"language-text\\">a</code>, the call stack is empty.</p>
<p>Of course, React itself runs in JavaScript and obeys JavaScript rules. But we can imagine that internally React has some kind of its own call stack to remember which component we are currently rendering, e.g. <code class=\\"language-text\\">[App, Page, Layout, Article /* we&#39;re here */]</code>.</p>
<p>React is different from a general purpose language runtime because it’s aimed at rendering UI trees. These trees need to “stay alive” for us to interact with them. The DOM doesn’t disappear after our first <code class=\\"language-text\\">ReactDOM.render()</code> call.</p>
<p>This may be stretching the metaphor but I like to think of React components as being in a “call tree” rather than just a “call stack”. When we go “out” of the <code class=\\"language-text\\">Article</code> component, its React “call tree” frame doesn’t get destroyed. We need to keep the local state and references to the host instances <a href=\\"https://medium.com/react-in-depth/the-how-and-why-on-reacts-usage-of-linked-list-in-fiber-67f1014d0eb7\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">somewhere</a>.</p>
<p>These “call tree” frames <em>are</em> destroyed along with their local state and host instances, but only when the <a href=\\"#reconciliation\\">reconciliation</a> rules say it’s necessary. If you ever read React source, you might have seen these frames being referred to as <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science)\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Fibers</a>.</p>
<p>Fibers are where the local state actually lives. When the state is updated, React marks the Fibers below as needing reconciliation, and calls those components.</p>

<p>In React, we pass things down to other components as props. Sometimes, the majority of components need the same thing — for example, the currently chosen visual theme. It gets cumbersome to pass it down through every level.</p>
<p>In React, this is solved by <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Context</a>. It is essentially like <a href=\\"http://wiki.c2.com/?DynamicScoping\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">dynamic scoping</a> for components. It’s like a wormhole that lets you put something on the top, and have every child at the bottom be able to read it and re-render when it changes.</p>

<p>We mentioned earlier that React components shouldn’t have observable side effects during rendering. But side effects are sometimes necessary. We may want to manage focus, draw on a canvas, subscribe to a data source, and so on.</p>
<p>In React, this is done by declaring an effect:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Example</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When possible, React defers executing effects until after the browser re-paints the screen. This is good because code like data source subscriptions shouldn’t hurt <a href=\\"https://calibreapp.com/blog/time-to-interactive/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">time to interactive</a> and <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-meaningful-paint\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">time to first paint</a>. (There’s a <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#uselayouteffect\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">rarely used</a> Hook that lets you opt out of that behavior and do things synchronously. Avoid it.)</p>
<p>Effects don’t just run once. They run both after a component is shown to the user for the first time, and after it updates. Effects can close over current props and state, such as with <code class=\\"language-text\\">count</code> in the above example.</p>
<p>Effects may require cleanup, such as in case of subscriptions. To clean up after itself, an effect can return a function:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    DataSource<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">addSubscription</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>handleChange<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> DataSource<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">removeSubscription</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>handleChange<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>React will execute the returned function before applying this effect the next time, and also before the component is destroyed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, re-running the effect on every render can be undesirable. You can tell React to <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">skip</a> applying an effect if certain variables didn’t change:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    document<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>title <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token template-string\\"><span class=\\"token string\\">\`You clicked </span><span class=\\"token interpolation\\"><span class=\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\">\${</span>count<span class=\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\">}</span></span><span class=\\"token string\\"> times\`</span></span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>count<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, it is often a premature optimization and can lead to problems if you’re not familiar with how JavaScript closures work.</p>
<p>For example, this code is buggy:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    DataSource<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">addSubscription</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>handleChange<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> DataSource<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">removeSubscription</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>handleChange<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is buggy because <code class=\\"language-text\\">[]</code> says “don’t ever re-execute this effect”. But the effect closes over <code class=\\"language-text\\">handleChange</code> which is defined outside of it. And <code class=\\"language-text\\">handleChange</code> might reference any props or state:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">handleChange</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    console<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">log</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>count<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we never let the effect re-run, <code class=\\"language-text\\">handleChange</code> will keep pointing at the version from the first render, and <code class=\\"language-text\\">count</code> will always be <code class=\\"language-text\\">0</code> inside of it.</p>
<p>To solve this, make sure that if you specify the dependency array, it includes <strong>all</strong> things that can change, including the functions:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">useEffect</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    DataSource<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">addSubscription</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>handleChange<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> DataSource<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">removeSubscription</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>handleChange<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>handleChange<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Depending on your code, you might still see unnecessary resubscriptions because <code class=\\"language-text\\">handleChange</code> itself is different on every render. The <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useCallback</code></a> Hook can help you with that. Alternatively, you can just let it re-subscribe. For example, browser’s <code class=\\"language-text\\">addEventListener</code> API is extremely fast, and jumping through hoops to avoid calling it might cause more problems than it’s worth.</p>

<p>Custom Hooks let different components share reusable stateful logic. Note that the <em>state itself</em> is not shared. Each call to a Hook declares its own isolated state.</p>

<p>You can think of <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState</code> as a syntax for defining a “React state variable”. It’s not <em>really</em> a syntax, of course. We’re still writing JavaScript. But we are looking at React as a runtime environment, and because React tailors JavaScript to describing UI trees, its features sometimes live closer to the language space.</p>
<p>If <code class=\\"language-text\\">use</code> <em>were</em> a syntax, it would make sense for it to be at the top level:</p>

<p>React state is local to the <em>component</em> and its identity in the tree. If <code class=\\"language-text\\">use</code> were a real syntax it would make sense to scope it to the top-level of a component too:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// 😉 Note: not a real syntax</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is similar to how <code class=\\"language-text\\">import</code> only works at the top level of a module.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, <code class=\\"language-text\\">use</code> is not actually a syntax.</strong> (It wouldn’t bring much benefit and would create a lot of friction.)</p>
<p>However, React <em>does</em> expect that all calls to Hooks happen only at the top level of a component and unconditionally. These <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Rules of Hooks</a> can be enforced with <a href=\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">a linter plugin</a>. There have been heated arguments about this design choice but in practice, I haven’t seen it confusing people. I also wrote about why commonly proposed alternatives <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/why-do-hooks-rely-on-call-order/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">don’t work</a>.</p>
<p>Internally, Hooks are implemented as <a href=\\"https://dev.to/aspittel/thank-u-next-an-introduction-to-linked-lists-4pph\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">linked lists</a>. When you call <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState</code>, we move the pointer to the next item. When we exit the component’s <a href=\\"#call-tree\\">“call tree” frame</a>, we save the resulting list there until the next render.</p>

<p>This is roughly how each <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> call gets the right state. As we’ve learned <a href=\\"#reconciliation\\">earlier</a>, “matching things up” isn’t new to React — reconciliation relies on the elements matching up between renders in a similar way.</p>

<p>We’ve touched on pretty much all important aspects of the React runtime environment. If you finished this page, you probably know React in more detail than 90% of its users. And there’s nothing wrong with that!</p>
<p>There are some parts I left out — mostly because they’re unclear even to us. React doesn’t currently have a good story for multipass rendering, i.e. when the parent render needs information about the children. Also, the <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">error handling API</a> doesn’t yet have a Hooks version. It’s possible that these two problems can be solved together. Concurrent Mode is not stable yet, and there are interesting questions about how Suspense fits into this picture. Maybe I’ll do a follow-up when they’re fleshed out and Suspense is ready for more than <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html#reactlazy-code-splitting-with-suspense\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">lazy loading</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I think it speaks to the success of React’s API that you can get very far without ever thinking about most of these topics.</strong> Good defaults like the reconciliation heuristics do the right thing in most cases. Warnings, like the <code class=\\"language-text\\">key</code> warning, nudge you when you risk shooting yourself in the foot.</p>
<p>If you’re a UI library nerd, I hope this post was somewhat entertaining and clarified how React works in more depth. Or maybe you decided React is too complicated and you’ll never look at it again. In either case, I’d love to hear from you on Twitter! Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>To remind you, here’s a few things that <em>are</em> Hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code></a> lets you declare a state variable.</li>
<li><a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useEffect()</code></a> lets you declare a side effect.</li>
<li><a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useContext()</code></a> lets you read some context.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are some other APIs, like <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.memo()</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Context.Provider&gt;</code>, that are <em>not</em> Hooks. Commonly proposed Hook versions of them would be <em>noncompositional</em> or <em>antimodular</em>. This article will help you understand why.</p>
<p><strong>Note: this post is a deep dive for folks who are interested in API discussions. You don’t need to think about any of this to be productive with React!</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>There are two important properties that we want React APIs to preserve:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Composition:</strong> <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Custom Hooks</a> are largely the reason we’re excited about the Hooks API. We expect people to build their own Hooks very often, and we need to make sure Hooks written by different people <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/why-do-hooks-rely-on-call-order/#flaw-4-the-diamond-problem\\">don’t conflict</a>. (Aren’t we all spoiled by how components compose cleanly and don’t break each other?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debugging:</strong> We want the bugs to be <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/the-bug-o-notation/\\">easy to find</a> as the application grows. One of React’s best features is that if you see something wrong rendered, you can walk up the tree until you find which component’s prop or state caused the mistake.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two constraints put together can tell us what can or <em>cannot</em> be a Hook. Let’s try a few examples.</p>

<p>Adding a new unconditional <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> call is always safe. You don’t need to know anything about other Hooks used by a component to declare a new state variable. You also can’t break other state variables by updating one of them.</p>

<p>But what if we make a mistake? What’s the debugging story?</p>
<p>Let’s say the CSS class we get from <code class=\\"language-text\\">theme.comment</code> is wrong. How would we debug this? We can set a breakpoint or a few logs in the body of our component.</p>
<p>Maybe we’d see that <code class=\\"language-text\\">theme</code> is wrong but <code class=\\"language-text\\">width</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">isMobile</code> are correct. That would tell us the problem is inside <code class=\\"language-text\\">useTheme()</code>. Or perhaps we’d see that <code class=\\"language-text\\">width</code> itself is wrong. That would tell us to look into <code class=\\"language-text\\">useWindowWidth()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>A single look at the intermediate values tells us which of the Hooks at the top level contains the bug.</strong> We don’t need to look at <em>all</em> of their implementations.</p>
<p>Then we can “zoom in” on the one that has a bug, and repeat.</p>
<p>This becomes more important if the depth of custom Hook nesting increases. Imagine we have 3 levels of custom Hook nesting, each level using 3 different custom Hooks inside. The <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/the-bug-o-notation/\\">difference</a> between looking for a bug in <strong>3 places</strong> versus potentially checking <strong>3 + 3×3 + 3×3×3 = 39 places</strong> is enormous. Luckily, <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> can’t magically “influence” other Hooks or components. A buggy value returned by it leaves a trail behind it, just like any variable. 🐛</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> ✅ <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> doesn’t obscure the cause-effect relationship in our code. We can follow the breadcrumbs directly to the bug.</p>

<p>As an optimization, components using Hooks can bail out of re-rendering.</p>
<p>One way to do it is to put a <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html#reactmemo\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">React.memo()</code></a> wrapper around the whole component. It bails out of re-rendering if props are shallowly equal to what we had during the last render. This makes it similar to <code class=\\"language-text\\">PureComponent</code> in classes.</p>
<p><code class=\\"language-text\\">React.memo()</code> takes a component and returns a component:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Button</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p><strong>But why isn’t it just a Hook?</strong></p>
<p>Whether you call it <code class=\\"language-text\\">useShouldComponentUpdate()</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">usePure()</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">useSkipRender()</code>, or <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code>, the proposal tends to look something like this:</p>

<p>When does it re-render?</p>
<p>If every <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code> call has the power to skip an update, then updates from <code class=\\"language-text\\">useWindowWidth()</code> would be blocked by <code class=\\"language-text\\">useFriendStatus()</code>, and vice versa. <strong>These Hooks would break each other.</strong></p>
<p>However, if <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code> was only respected when <em>all</em> calls to it inside a single component “agree” to block an update, our <code class=\\"language-text\\">ChatThread</code> would fail to update on changes to the <code class=\\"language-text\\">isTyping</code> prop.</p>
<p>Even worse, with these semantics <strong>any newly added Hooks to <code class=\\"language-text\\">ChatThread</code> would break if they don’t <em>also</em> call <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code></strong>. Otherwise, they can’t “vote against” the bailout inside <code class=\\"language-text\\">useWindowWidth()</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">useFriendStatus()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> 🔴 <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code> breaks composition. Adding it to a Hook breaks state updates in other Hooks. We want the APIs to be <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/\\">antifragile</a>, and this behavior is pretty much the opposite.</p>

<p>How does a Hook like <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code> affect debugging?</p>
<p>We’ll use the same example:</p>

<p>Let’s say the <code class=\\"language-text\\">Typing...</code> label doesn’t appear when we expect, even though somewhere many layers above the prop is changing. How do we debug it?</p>
<p><strong>Normally, in React you can confidently answer this question by looking <em>up</em>.</strong> If <code class=\\"language-text\\">ChatThread</code> doesn’t get a new <code class=\\"language-text\\">isTyping</code> value, we can open the component that renders <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;ChatThread isTyping={myVar} /&gt;</code> and check <code class=\\"language-text\\">myVar</code>, and so on. At one of these levels, we’ll either find a buggy <code class=\\"language-text\\">shouldComponentUpdate()</code> bailout, or an incorrect <code class=\\"language-text\\">isTyping</code> value being passed down. One look at each component in the chain is usually enough to locate the source of the problem.</p>
<p>However, if this <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code> Hook was real, you would never know the reason an update was skipped until you checked <em>every single custom Hook</em> (deeply) used by our <code class=\\"language-text\\">ChatThread</code> and components in its owner chain. Since every parent component can <em>also</em> use custom Hooks, this <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/the-bug-o-notation/\\">scales</a> terribly.</p>
<p>It’s like if you were looking for a screwdriver in a chest of drawers, and each drawer contained a bunch of smaller chests of drawers, and you don’t know how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> 🔴 Not only <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code> Hook breaks composition, but it also vastly increases the number of debugging steps and cognitive load for finding a buggy bailout — in some cases, exponentially.</p>
<hr>
<p>We just looked at one real Hook, <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code>, and a common suggestion that is intentionally <em>not</em> a Hook — <code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code>. We compared them through the prism of Composition and Debugging, and discussed why one of them works and the other one doesn’t.</p>
<p>While there is no “Hook version” of <code class=\\"language-text\\">memo()</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">shouldComponentUpdate()</code>, React <em>does</em> provide a Hook called <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">useMemo()</code></a>. It serves a similar purpose, but its semantics are different enough to not run into the pitfalls described above.</p>
<p><code class=\\"language-text\\">useBailout()</code> is just one example of something that doesn’t work well as a Hook. But there are a few others — for example, <code class=\\"language-text\\">useProvider()</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">useCatch()</code>, or <code class=\\"language-text\\">useSuspense()</code>.</p>
<p>Can you see why?</p>

It is often expressed with the <a href=\\"https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Big-O notation</a>.</p>
<p>Big-O is a measure of <strong>how much slower the code will get as you throw more data at it</strong>. For example, if a sorting algorithm has O(<i>n<sup>2</sup></i>) complexity, sorting ×50 times more items will be roughly 50<sup>2</sup> = 2,500 times slower. Big O doesn’t give you an exact number, but it helps you understand how an algorithm <em>scales</em>.</p>
<p>Some examples: O(<i>n</i>), O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>), O(<i>n<sup>2</sup></i>), O(<i>n!</i>).</p>
<p>However, <strong>this post isn’t about algorithms or performance</strong>. It’s about APIs and debugging. It turns out, API design involves very similar considerations.</p>
<hr>
<p>A significant part of our time goes into finding and fixing mistakes in our code. Most developers would like to find bugs faster. As satisfactory as it may be in the end, it sucks to spend the whole day chasing a single bug when you could have implemented something from your roadmap.</p>
<p>Debugging experience influences our choice of abstractions, libraries, and tools. Some API and language designs make a whole class of mistakes impossible. Some create endless problems. <strong>But how can you tell which one is which?</strong></p>
<p>Many online discussions about APIs are primarily concerned with aesthetics. But that <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/\\">doesn’t say much</a> about what it feels like to use an API in practice.</p>
<p><strong>I have a metric that helps me think about this. I call it the <em>Bug-O</em> notation:</strong></p>
<p><font size=\\"40\\">🐞(<i>n</i>)</font></p>
<p>The Big-O describes how much an algorithm slows down as the inputs grow. The <em>Bug-O</em> describes how much an API slows <em>you</em> down as your codebase grows.</p>

<p>The problem with this code isn’t that it’s “ugly”. We’re not talking about aesthetics. <strong>The problem is that if there is a bug in this code, I don’t know where to start looking.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Depending on the order in which the callbacks and events fire, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of codepaths this program could take.</strong> In some of them, I’ll see the right messages. In others, I’ll see multiple spinners, failure and error messages together, and possibly crashes.</p>
<p>This function has 4 different sections and no guarantees about their ordering. My very non-scientific calculation tells me there are 4×3×2×1 = 24 different orders in which they could run. If I add four more code segments, it’ll be 8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1 — <em>forty thousand</em> combinations. Good luck debugging that.</p>
<p><strong>In other words, the Bug-O of this approach is 🐞(<i>n!</i>)</strong> where <em>n</em> is the number of code segments touching the DOM. Yeah, that’s a <em>factorial</em>. Of course, I’m not being very scientific here. Not all transitions are possible in practice. But on the other hand, each of these segments can run more than once. <span style=\\"word-break: keep-all\\">🐞(<em>¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯</em>)</span> might be more accurate but it’s still pretty bad. We can do better.</p>
<hr>

<p>This code might not look too different. It’s even a bit more verbose. But it is <em>dramatically</em> simpler to debug because of this line:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">setState</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>nextState<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Clear all existing children</span>
<span class=\\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\\">  formStatus<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>innerHTML <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">''</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ... the code adding stuff to formStatus ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By clearing out the form status before doing any manipulations, we ensure that our DOM operations always start from scratch. This is how we can fight the inevitable <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/\\">entropy</a> — by <em>not</em> letting the mistakes accumulate. This is the coding equivalent of “turning it off and on again”, and it works amazingly well.</p>
<p><strong>If there is a bug in the output, we only need to think <em>one</em> step back — to the previous <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> call.</strong> The Bug-O of debugging a rendering result is 🐞(<em>n</em>) where <em>n</em> is the number of rendering code paths. Here, it’s just four (because we have four cases in a <code class=\\"language-text\\">switch</code>).</p>
<p>We might still have race conditions in <em>setting</em> the state, but debugging those is easier because each intermediate state can be logged and inspected. We can also disallow any undesired transitions explicitly:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">trySubmit</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, always resetting the DOM comes with a tradeoff. Naïvely removing and recreating the DOM every time would destroy its internal state, lose focus, and cause terrible performance problems in larger applications.</p>
<p>That’s why libraries like React can be helpful. They let you <em>think</em> in the paradigm of always recreating the UI from scratch without necessarily doing it:</p>

<p>The code may look different, but the principle is the same. The component abstraction enforces boundaries so that you know no <em>other</em> code on the page could mess with its DOM or state. Componentization helps reduce the Bug-O.</p>
<p>In fact, if <em>any</em> value looks wrong in the DOM of a React app, you can trace where it comes from by looking at the code of components above it in the React tree one by one. No matter the app size, tracing a rendered value is 🐞(<em>tree height</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Next time you see an API discussion, consider: what is the 🐞(<em>n</em>) of common debugging tasks in it?</strong> What about existing APIs and principles you’re deeply familiar with? Redux, CSS, inheritance — they all have their own Bug-O.</p>

<p>Sometimes people ask me how I prepare for a talk. For every speaker, the answer is very personal. I’m just sharing what works for me.</p>
<p><strong>This is the second post in a series</strong> where I explain my process preparing for a tech talk — from conceiving the idea to the actual day of the presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/preparing-for-tech-talk-part-1-motivation/\\">Preparing for a Tech Talk, Part 1: Motivation</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Preparing for a Tech Talk, Part 2: What, Why, and How (<em>this post</em>)</strong></li>
<li>To be continued</li>
</ul>
<p />
<hr>
<p><strong>In this post, I will focus on finding the What, Why, and How of my talk.</strong> Doing this early helps me avoid a lot of headache at a later stage.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you haven’t seen <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Inception</a>, watch it today. It’s an enjoyable blockbuster with mindbending visuals and a stimulating plot. But as <a href=\\"https://mobile.twitter.com/ryanflorence\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Ryan Florence</a> taught me, it also contains good advice for creating a memorable talk.</p>
<p>That movie is about putting ideas into other people’s heads while they sleep. This might sound a bit invasive (and is illegal in the movie). But if you signed up to give a tech talk, that’s a pretty accurate description of your challenge.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What is the one thing that you want people to take away from your talk?</strong> I try to formulate it as a sentence early on. This idea shouldn’t be longer than a dozen words. People will forget most of what you say so you need to pick carefully <em>what</em> you want to stick. It’s the seed you want to plant in their heads.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the core ideas of my talks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Hot Reloading</a>: “Functional principles improve the development workflow.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLF0n9SACd4\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Beyond React 16</a>: “Waiting for CPU and IO has a unified solution.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Introducing Hooks</a>: “Hooks make stateful logic reusable.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t always explicitly <em>say</em> the central idea out loud or write it on a slide, but it is always the intellectual backbone of my talk. Everything I say and show must ultimately work towards supporting this idea. I want to prove it to you.</p>
<hr>
<p>An idea is the <strong>“What”</strong> of my talk. But there is also <strong>“How”</strong> and <strong>“Why”</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>“How”</strong> is my method for delivering the idea to the audience. Personally, I prefer live demos, but there are many things that can work. I will talk more about “How” in the later blog posts in this series.</p>
<p>We’ve just discussed <strong>“What”</strong> which is the core idea of the talk. It’s the thought I want to plant in your head and the insight I want you to walk away with. It’s what I want people to share with their friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <strong>“Why”</strong>. </p>
<hr>
<p>To explain <strong>“Why”</strong>, I’ll quote this dialog from the Inception movie:</p>
<p><strong>(warning: spoilers!)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> “I will split up my father’s empire.” Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself will choose to reject. Which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?</p>
<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> That’s what we’re here to figure out, right. Now Robert’s relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>Eames:</strong> Well can we run with that? We could suggest him breaking up his fathers company as a “screw you” to the old man.</p>
<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> No, cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis. We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.</p>
<p><strong>Eames:</strong> Alright, well, try this? “My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.”</p>
<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> That might work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I’m not suggesting that you break up empires with your talk.</p>
<p>But there must be a <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/preparing-for-tech-talk-part-1-motivation/\\">reason</a> you get out in front of thousands of people to speak about something. You <em>believe</em> in something — and you want others to share that feeling. <strong>This is the “Why” — the emotional core of your talk.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s the example “What”, “Why”, and “How” from my talks.</p>

<p>A memorable talk takes a concise idea, makes the audience care about it, and has a clear and convincing execution. That’s the “What”, “Why”, and “How”.</p>
<hr>
<p>In this post, I described how I organize the core ideas of my talks. Again, I want to emphasize I’m just sharing what works for me — there are <a href=\\"https://mobile.twitter.com/jackiehluo/status/1077717283026411520\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">many kinds of talks</a> and your outlook on this may be very different.</p>
<p>In the next posts in this series, I will talk about preparing the talk outline, slides, rehearsing the talks, and what I do on the day of the presentation.</p>

          "value": "<p>In my <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/\\">previous post</a>, I talked about admitting our knowledge gaps. You might conclude that I suggest settling for mediocrity. I don’t! This is a broad field.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that you can “begin anywhere” and don’t need to learn technologies in any particular order. But I also place great value in gaining expertise. Personally I’ve mostly been interested in creating user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve been mulling over what it is that I <em>do</em> know about and consider valuable.</strong> Sure, I’m familiar with a few technologies (e.g. JavaScript and React). But the more important lessons from experience are elusive. I never tried to put them into words. This is my first attempt to catalog and describe some of them.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are plenty of “learning roadmaps” about technologies and libraries. Which library is going to be in vogue in 2019? What about 2020? Should you learn Vue or React? Angular? What about Redux or Rx? Do you need to learn Apollo? REST or GraphQL? It’s easy to get lost. What if the author is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>My biggest learning breakthroughs weren’t about a particular technology.</strong> Rather, I learned the most when I struggled to solve a particular UI problem. Sometimes, I would later discover libraries or patterns that helped me. In other cases, I’d come up with my own solutions (both good and bad ones).</p>
<p>It’s this combination of understanding the <em>problems</em>, experimenting with the <em>solutions</em>, and applying different <em>strategies</em> that led to the most rewarding learning experiences in my life. <strong>This post focuses on just the problems.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>If you worked a user interface, you’ve likely dealt with at least some of these challenges — either directly or using a library. In either case, I encourage you to create a tiny app with <em>no</em> libraries, and play with reproducing and solving these problems. There’s no one right solution to any of them. Learning comes from exploring the problem space and trying different possible tradeoffs.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency.</strong> You click on a “Like” button and the text updates: “You and 3 other friends liked this post.” You click it again, and the text flips back. Sounds easy. But maybe a label like this exists in several places on the screen. Maybe there is some other visual indication (such as the button background) that needs to change. The list of “likers” that was previously fetched from the server and is visible on hover should now include your name. If you navigate to another screen and go back, the post shouldn’t “forget” it was liked. Even local consistency <em>alone</em> creates a set of challenges. But other users might also modify the data we display (e.g. by liking a post we’re viewing). How do we keep the same data in sync on different parts of the screen? How and when do we make the local data consistent with the server, and the other way around?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsiveness.</strong> People can only tolerate a lack of visual feedback to their actions for a limited time. For <em>continuous</em> actions like gestures and scroll, this limit is low. (Even skipping a single 16ms frame feels “janky”.) For <em>discrete</em> actions like clicks, there is research saying users perceive any &#x3C; 100ms delays as equally fast. If an action takes longer, we need to show a visual indicator. But there are some counter-intuitive challenges. Indicators that cause the page layout to “jump” or that go through several loading “stages” can make the action <em>feel longer</em> than it was. Similarly, handling an interaction within 20ms at the cost of dropping an animation frame can <em>feel slower</em> than handling it within 30ms and no dropped frames. Brains aren’t benchmarks. How do we keep our apps responsive to different kinds of inputs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Latency.</strong> Both computations and network access take time. <em>Sometimes</em> we can ignore the computational cost if it doesn’t hurt the responsiveness on our target devices (make sure to test your app on the low-end device spectrum). But handling network latency is unavoidable — it can take seconds! Our app can’t just freeze waiting for the data or code to load. This means any action that depends on new data, code, or assets is potentially asynchronous and needs to handle the “loading” case. But that can happen for almost every screen. How do we gracefully handle latency without displaying a “cascade” of spinners or empty “holes”? How do we avoid “jumpy” layout? And how do we change async dependencies without “rewiring” our code every time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigation.</strong> We expect that the UI remains “stable” as we interact with it. Things shouldn’t disappear from right under our noses. Navigation, whether started within the app (e.g. clicking a link) or due to an external event (e.g. clicking the “back” button), should also respect this principle. For example, switching between <code class=\\"language-text\\">/profile/likes</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">/profile/follows</code> tabs on a profile screen shouldn’t clear a search input outside the tabbed view. Even navigating to <em>another</em> screen is like walking into a room. People expect to go back later and find things as they left them (with, perhaps, some new items). If you’re in the middle of a feed, click on a profile, and go back, it’s frustrating to lose your position in the feed — or wait for it to load again. How do we architect our app to handle arbitrary navigation without losing important context?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Staleness.</strong> We can make the “back” button navigation instant by introducing a local cache. In that cache, we can “remember” some data for quick access even if we could theoretically refetch it. But caching brings its own problems. Caches can get stale. If I change an avatar, it should update in the cache too. If I make a new post, it needs to appear in the cache immediately, or the cache needs to be invalidated. This can become difficult and error-prone. What if the posting fails? How long does the cache stay in memory? When we refetch the feed, do we “stitch” the newly fetched feed with the cached one, or throw the cache away? How is pagination or sorting represented in the cache?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entropy.</strong> The second law of thermodynamics says something like “with time, things turn into a mess” (well, not exactly). This applies to user interfaces too. We can’t predict the exact user interactions and their order. At any point in time, our app may be in one of a mind-boggling number of possible states. We do our best to make the result predictable and limited by our design. We don’t want to look at a bug screenshot and wonder “how did <em>that</em> happen”. For <em>N</em> possible states, there are <em>N×(N–1)</em> possible transitions between them. For example, if a button can be in one of 5 different states (normal, active, hover, danger, disabled), the code updating the button must be correct for 5×4=20 possible transitions — or forbid some of them. How do we tame the combinatorial explosion of possible states and make visual output predictable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Priority.</strong> Some things are more important than others. A dialog might need to appear physically “above” the button that spawned it and “break out” of its container’s clip boundaries. A newly scheduled task (e.g. responding to a click) might be more important than a long-running task that already started (e.g. rendering next posts below the screen fold). As our app grows, parts of its code written by different people and teams compete for limited resources like processor, network, screen estate, and the bundle size budget. Sometimes you can rank the contenders on a shared scale of “importance”, like the CSS <code class=\\"language-text\\">z-index</code> property. <a href=\\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050607-00/?p=35413\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">But it rarely ends well.</a> Every developer is biased to think <em>their</em> code is important. And if everything is important, then nothing is! How do we get independent widgets to <em>cooperate</em> instead of fighting for resources?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility.</strong> Inaccessible websites are <em>not</em> a niche problem. For example, in UK disability affects 1 in 5 people. <a href=\\"https://www.abrightclearweb.com/web-accessibility-in-the-uk/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">(Here’s a nice infographic.)</a> I’ve felt this personally too. Though I’m only 26, I struggle to read websites with thin fonts and low contrast. I try to use the trackpad less often, and I dread the day I’ll have to navigate poorly implemented websites by keyboard. We need to make our apps not horrible to people with difficulties — and the good news is that there’s a lot of low-hanging fruit. It starts with education and tooling. But we also need to make it easy for product developers to do the right thing. What can we do to make accessibility a <em>default</em> rather than an afterthought?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internationalization.</strong> Our app needs to work all over the world. Not only do people speak different languages, but we also need to support right-to-left layouts with the least amount of effort from product engineers. How do we support different languages without sacrificing latency and responsiveness?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delivery.</strong> We need to get our application code to the user’s computer. What transport and format do we use? This might sound straightforward but there are many tradeoffs here. For example, native apps tend to load all code in advance at the cost of a huge app size. Web apps tend to have smaller initial payload at the cost of more latency during use. How do we choose at which point to introduce latency? How do we optimize our delivery based on the usage patterns? What kind of data would we need for an optimal solution?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience.</strong> You might like bugs if you’re an entomologist, but you probably don’t enjoy seeing them in your programs. However, some of your bugs will inevitably get to production. What happens then? Some bugs cause wrong but well-defined behavior. For example, maybe your code displays incorrect visual output under some condition. But what if the rendering code <em>crashes</em>? Then we can’t meaningfully continue because the visual output would be inconsistent. A crash rendering a single post shouldn’t “bring down” an entire feed or get it into a semi-broken state that causes further crashes. How do we write code in a way that isolates rendering and fetching failures and keeps the rest of the app running? What does fault tolerance mean for user interfaces?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstraction.</strong> In a tiny app, we can hardcode a lot of special cases to account for the above problems. But apps tend to grow. We want to be able to <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/\\">reuse, fork, and join</a> parts of our code, and work on it collectively. We want to define clear boundaries between the pieces familiar to different people, and avoid making often-changing logic too rigid. How do we create abstractions that hide implementation details of a particular UI part? How do we avoid re-introducing the same problems that we just solved as our app grows?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Of course, there are many problems I haven’t mentioned. This list is by no means exhaustive! For example, I haven’t talked about the designer and engineering collaboration, or debugging and testing. Maybe another time.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to read about these problems with a particular view library or a data fetching library in mind as a solution. But I encourage you to pretend that these libraries don’t exist, and read again from that perspective. How would <em>you</em> approach solving these issues? Give them a try on a tiny app! (I’d love to see your experiments on GitHub — feel free to tweet me in response.)</p>
<p>What’s interesting about these problems is that most of them show up at any scale. You can see them both in small widgets like a typeahead or a tooltip, and in huge apps like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Think of a non-trivial UI element from an app you enjoy using, and go through this list of problems. Can you describe some of the tradeoffs chosen by its developers? Try to recreate a similar behavior from scratch!</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot about UI engineering by experimenting with these problems in small apps without using libraries. I recommend the same to anyone who wants to gain a deeper appreciation for the tradeoffs in UI engineering.</p>

          "value": "<p>People often assume that I know far more than I actually do. That’s not a bad problem to have and I’m not complaining. (Folks from minority groups often suffer the opposite bias despite their hard-earned credentials, and that <em>sucks</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>In this post I’ll offer an incomplete list of programming topics that people often wrongly assume that I know.</strong> I’m not saying <em>you</em> don’t need to learn them — or that I don’t know <em>other</em> useful things. But since I’m not in a vulnerable position myself right now, I can be honest about this.</p>
<p>Here’s why I think it’s important.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, there is often an unrealistic expectation that an experienced engineer knows every technology in their field. Have you seen a “learning roadmap” that consists of a hundred libraries and tools? It’s useful — but intimidating.</p>
<p>What’s more, no matter how experienced you get, you may still find yourself switching between feeling capable, inadequate (“Impostor syndrome”), and overconfident (“Dunning–Kruger effect”). It depends on your environment, job, personality, teammates, mental state, time of day, and so on.</p>
<p>Experienced developers sometimes open up about their insecurities to encourage beginners. But there’s a world of difference between a seasoned surgeon who still gets the jitters and a student holding their first scalpel!</p>
<p>Hearing how “we’re all junior developers” can be disheartening and sound like empty talk to the learners faced with an actual gap in knowledge. Feel-good confessions from well-intentioned practitioners like me can’t bridge it.</p>
<p>Still, even experienced engineers have many knowledge gaps. This post is about mine, and I encourage those who can afford similar vulnerability to share their own. But let’s not devalue our experience while we do that.</p>
<p><strong>We can admit our knowledge gaps, may or may not feel like impostors, and still have deeply valuable expertise that takes years of hard work to develop.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>With that disclaimer out of the way, here’s just a few things I don’t know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unix commands and Bash.</strong> I can <code class=\\"language-text\\">ls</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">cd</code> but I look up everything else. I get the concept of piping but I’ve only used it in simple cases. I don’t know how to use <code class=\\"language-text\\">xargs</code> to create complex chains, or how to compose and redirect different output streams. I also never properly learned Bash so I can only write very simple (and often buggy) shell scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low-level languages.</strong> I understand Assembly lets you store things in memory and jump around the code but that’s about it. I wrote a few lines of C and understand what a pointer is, but I don’t know how to use <code class=\\"language-text\\">malloc</code> or other manual memory management techniques. Never played with Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Networking stack.</strong> I know computers have IP addresses, and DNS is how we resolve hostnames. I know there’s low level protocols like TCP/IP to exchange packets that (maybe?) ensure integrity. That’s it — I’m fuzzy on details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Containers.</strong> I have no idea about how to use Docker or Kubernetes. (Are those related?) I have a vague idea that they let me spin up a separate VM in a predictable way. Sounds cool but I haven’t tried it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serverless.</strong> Also sounds cool. Never tried it. I don’t have a clear idea of how that model changes backend programming (if it does at all).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Microservices.</strong> If I understand correctly, this just means “many API endpoints talking to each other”. I don’t know what the practical advantages or downsides of this approach are because I haven’t worked with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Python.</strong> I feel bad about this one — I <em>have</em> worked with Python for several years at some point and I’ve never bothered to actually learn it. There are many things there like import behavior that are completely opaque to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Node backends.</strong> I understand how to run Node, used some APIs like <code class=\\"language-text\\">fs</code> for build tooling, and can set up Express. But I’ve never talked from Node to a database and don’t really know how to write a backend in it. I’m also not familiar with React frameworks like Next beyond a “hello world”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Native platforms.</strong> I tried learning Objective C at some point but it didn’t work out. I haven’t learned Swift either. Same about Java. (I could probably pick it up though since I worked with C#.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Algorithms.</strong> The most you’ll get out of me is bubble sort and maybe quicksort on a good day. I can probably do simple graph traversing tasks if they’re tied to a particular practical problem. I understand the O(n) notation but my understanding isn’t much deeper than “don’t put loops inside loops”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional languages.</strong> Unless you count JavaScript, I’m not fluent in any traditionally functional language. (I’m only fluent in C# and JavaScript — and I already forgot most of C#.) I struggle to read either LISP-inspired (like Clojure), Haskell-inspired (like Elm), or ML-inspired (like OCaml) code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional terminology.</strong> Map and reduce is as far as I go. I don’t know monoids, functors, etc. I know what a monad is but maybe that’s an illusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modern CSS.</strong> I don’t know Flexbox or Grid. Floats are my jam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CSS Methodologies.</strong> I used BEM (meaning the CSS part, not the original BEM) but that’s all I know. I haven’t tried OOCSS or other methodologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SCSS / Sass.</strong> Never got to learn them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CORS.</strong> I dread these errors! I know I need to set up some headers to fix them but I’ve wasted hours here in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTTPS / SSL.</strong> Never set it up. Don’t know how it works beyond the idea of private and public keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GraphQL.</strong> I can read a query but I don’t really know how to express stuff with nodes and edges, when to use fragments, and how pagination works there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sockets.</strong> My mental model is they let computers talk to each other outside the request/response model but that’s about all I know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Streams.</strong> Aside from Rx Observables, I haven’t worked with streams closely. I used old Node streams one or two times but always messed up error handling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electron.</strong> Never tried it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TypeScript.</strong> I understand the concept of types and can read annotations but I’ve never written it. The few times I tried, I ran into difficulties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment and devops.</strong> I can manage to send some files over FTP or kill some processes but that’s the limit of my devops skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Graphics.</strong> Whether it’s canvas, SVG, WebGL or low-level graphics, I’m not productive in it. I get the overall idea but I’d need to learn the primitives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this list is not exhaustive. There are many things that I don’t know.</p>
<hr>
<p>It might seem like a strange thing to discuss. It even feels wrong to write it. Am I boasting of my ignorance? My intended takeaway from this post is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Even your favorite developers may not know many things that you know.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regardless of your knowledge level, your confidence can vary greatly.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experienced developers have valuable expertise despite knowledge gaps.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m aware of my knowledge gaps (at least, some of them). I can fill them in later if I become curious or if I need them for a project.</p>
<p>This doesn’t devalue my knowledge and experience. There’s plenty of things that I can do well. For example, learning technologies when I need them.</p>

<p>Sometimes people ask me how I prepare for a talk. For every speaker, the answer is very personal. I’m just sharing what works for me.</p>
<p><strong>This is the first post in a series</strong> where I explain my process preparing for a tech talk — from conceiving the idea to the actual day of the presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preparing for a Tech Talk, Part 1: Motivation (<em>this post</em>)</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/preparing-for-tech-talk-part-2-what-why-and-how/\\">Preparing for a Tech Talk, Part 2: What, Why, and How</a></strong></li>
<li>To be continued</li>
</ul>
<p />
<hr>
<p><strong>In this post, I will only focus on the first step: why and how I pick a topic.</strong> It’s not rich in practical tips but might help you ask yourself the right questions.</p>
<hr>
<p>What motivates <em>you</em> to give a talk?</p>
<p>Maybe giving talks is a part of your current job. Maybe you want to gain more recognition in the industry so you can land a better job or get a raise. Maybe you’re out there to bring more attention to your hobby or work project.</p>
<p>We’ll call these motivations <em>external</em>. They are about what other people think of you and your work. But if you already had all the respect and money that you wanted, would you still choose to give a talk? Why?</p>
<p>Maybe you find it rewarding to teach people. Maybe you enjoy learning, and giving a talk is a nice excuse to dig deeper. Maybe you want to start or change the conversation about a topic. Maybe you want to amplify or critique an idea.</p>
<p>Such <em>internal</em> motivations aren’t a proxy for another desire like professional recognition. These are the things that have intrinsic value to you. Different people are driven by different internal motivations. It’s helpful to be aware of yours. You can sometimes trace them all the way back to your childhood.</p>
<p>For example, here’s mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I enjoy sharing ideas that inspire me.</strong> Sometimes, an idea transforms the way I think. It opens many doors that I didn’t even know existed. But it’s lonely behind those doors. I want others to join me so that they can show me even more interesting doors inside. For me, a talk is a way to collect, curate, and amplify ideas that I find tasteful. (As a teenager I made mixtapes for crushes with no interest in my music taste. Now I do talks! Life, uh, finds a way.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I enjoy re-explaining things in a simpler way.</strong> When I understand an idea, I get a very pleasant feeling — better than eating sweets. But learning doesn’t come easy to me. So when I finally “get” something, I want to share that feeling with the people who are still struggling. I try to remember what it was like <em>before</em> the a-ha moment to help others “make the jump” while watching my talks. (I was also insufferable as a child because I insisted that everyone asks me questions. A talk is a more productive way to channel that energy.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Combining these two internal motivations gives me a recipe for a personally satisfying talk: <strong>share an inspiring idea by re-explaining it in a simpler way</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>That is my formula. Yours might be different — think about it! Which talks made you feel in a special way? What are the structural similarities between them? (We’ll discuss the talk structure more in the next posts in this series.)</p>

<p>Giving a talk that’s aligned with your motivations is helpful in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s easier to pick a topic.</strong> My formula is “explain an inspiring idea and why you should care about it”. I can create talk proposals by applying this formula to any interesting concept that I learned. I’ll always have something to talk about as long as I’m listening to smart people with good ideas that deserve more exposure. There are many other possible formulas — find yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s less scary on stage.</strong> I get terrified 30 seconds before the talk but <em>the moment I start talking, I’m in my element</em>. The drive to share an inspiring idea overtakes the fear of being judged or doing something wrong. (Of course, this only works with good preparation which we’ll talk about in the next posts.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s more convincing.</strong> I can’t phrase it better than <a href=\\"https://mobile.twitter.com/sophiebits/status/1077723835481284608\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Sophie did</a>: if you’re enthusiastic about a topic, you can get the audience to care too. Enthusiasm doesn’t necessarily mean being loud or waving hands. Even if you’re calm, people can feel when there’s an emotional conviction behind a talk. (This is also why we can vibe to a <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SWIwW9mg8s\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">song</a> even if we don’t understand the words.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>There’s one more reason it helps when you’re genuinely excited about a topic. Feeling that you’re a part of something bigger does wonders for confidence.</p>
<p>My talks aren’t about <em>me</em> — they’re about an idea, and I’m just a messenger. Thousands of people on the livestream and in the audience aren’t really there to judge me (even if they think so). They came to experience the idea that I brought to share. My role is just to be a conduit from one mind to another. A lot of nerves and pressure from the talks disappeared after internalizing this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finding a formula that’s consistent with your motivations helps you establish your own voice. But how do you find a <em>specific</em> topic to which you can apply it?</p>
<p><strong>In my experience, good talks start as conversations.</strong> Somebody explains an idea to me, and then I try to explain it to someone else. I talk about it to a dozen people, and eventually I find explanations that “click”. Sometimes there’s a thought that seems neglected or misunderstood, and I try to get individual people to see it in a different light.</p>
<p>For me, a talk is just a way to generalize those conversations and make them one-to-many rather than one-to-one. It’s like a “library” you extract out of the “application code” of many in-person and social media conversations.</p>
<p>So if you want to give a great talk, <em>talking</em> to people is a good way to start.</p>

<p>In this post, I described the framework that I find helpful for thinking about talk ideas. Again, I want to emphasize I’m just sharing what works for me — there are <a href=\\"https://mobile.twitter.com/jackiehluo/status/1077717283026411520\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">many kinds of talks</a> and your outlook on this may be very different.</p>
<p>In the next posts in this series, I will talk about preparing the talk outline, slides, rehearsing the talks, and what I do on the day of the presentation.</p>

<p>When you read the docs, don’t miss <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">the most important page</a> about building your own Hooks! Too many people get fixated on some part of our messaging they disagree with (e.g. that learning classes is difficult) and miss the bigger picture behind Hooks. And the bigger picture is that <strong>Hooks are like <em>functional mixins</em> that let you create and compose your own abstractions.</strong></p>
<p>Hooks <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#what-is-the-prior-art-for-hooks\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">are influenced by some prior art</a> but I haven’t seen anything <em>quite</em> like them until Sebastian shared his idea with the team. Unfortunately, it’s easy to overlook the connection between the specific API choices and the valuable properties unlocked by this design. With this post I hope to help more people understand the rationale for the most controversial aspect of Hooks proposal.</p>
<p><strong>The rest of this post assumes you know the <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> Hook API and how to write a custom Hook. If you don’t, check out the earlier links. Also, keep in mind Hooks are experimental and you don’t have to learn them right now!</strong></p>
<p>(Disclaimer: this is a personal post and doesn’t necessarily reflect the opinions of the React team. It’s large, the topic is complex, and I may have made mistakes somewhere.)</p>

<p>The first and probably the biggest shock when you learn about Hooks is that they rely on <em>persistent call index between re-renders</em>. This has some <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">implications</a>.</p>
<p>This decision is obviously controversial. This is why, <a href=\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/9xs2r6/sebmarkbages_response_to_hooks_rfc_feedback/e9wh4um/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">against our principles</a>, we only published this proposal after we felt the documentation and talks describe it well enough for people to give it a fair chance.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re concerned about some aspects of the Hooks API design, I encourage you to read Sebastian’s <a href=\\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68#issuecomment-439314884\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">full response</a> to the 1,000+ comment RFC discussion.</strong> It is thorough but also quite dense. I could probably turn every paragraph of this comment into its own blog post. (In fact, I already <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/how-does-setstate-know-what-to-do/\\">did</a> that once!)</p>
<p>There is one specific part that I’d like to focus on today. As you may recall, each Hook can be used in a component more than once. For example, we can declare <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#tip-using-multiple-state-variables\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">multiple state variables</a> by calling <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> repeatedly:</p>

<p>Note that we use array destructuring syntax to name <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> state variables but these names are not passed to React. Instead, in this example <strong>React treats <code class=\\"language-text\\">name</code> as “the first state variable”, <code class=\\"language-text\\">surname</code> as “the second state variable”, and so on</strong>. Their <em>call index</em> is what gives them a stable identity between re-renders. This mental model is well-described <a href=\\"https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">in this article</a>.</p>
<p>On a surface level, relying on the call index just <em>feels wrong</em>. A gut feeling is a useful signal but it can be misleading — especially if we haven’t fully internalized the problem we’re solving. <strong>In this post, I’ll take a few commonly suggested alternative designs for Hooks and show where they break down.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This post won’t be exhaustive. Depending on how granular you’re counting, we’ve seen from a dozen to <em>hundreds</em> of different alternative proposals. We’ve also been <a href=\\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-future\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">thinking</a> about alternative component APIs for the last five years.</p>
<p>Blog posts like this are tricky because even if you cover a hundred alternatives, somebody can tweak one and say: “Ha, you didn’t think of <em>that</em>!”</p>
<p>In practice, different alternative proposals tend to overlap in their downsides. Rather than enumerate <em>all</em> the suggested APIs (which would take me months), I’ll demonstrate the most common flaws with specific examples. Categorizing other possible APIs by these problems could be an exercise to the reader. 🧐</p>
<p><em>That is not to say that Hooks are flawless.</em> But once you get familiar with the flaws of other solutions, you might find that the Hooks design makes some sense.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, many alternative proposals don’t allow <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">custom Hooks</a> at all. Perhaps we didn’t emphasize custom Hooks enough in the “motivation” docs. It’s difficult to do until the primitives are well-understood. So it’s a chicken-and-egg problem. But custom Hooks are largely the point of the proposal.</p>
<p>For example, an alternative banned multiple <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> calls in a component. You’d keep state in one object. That works for classes, right?</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Form</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To be clear, Hooks <em>do</em> allow this style. You don’t <em>have to</em> split your state into a bunch of state variables (see our <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#should-i-use-one-or-many-state-variables\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">recommendations</a> in the FAQ).</p>
<p>But the point of supporting multiple <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> calls is so that you can <em>extract</em> parts of stateful logic (state + effects) out of your components into custom Hooks which can <em>also</em> independently use local state and effects:</p>

<p>One common suggestion is to let <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> accept a key argument (e.g. a string) that uniquely identifies a particular state variable within a component.</p>

<p>This tries to avoid reliance on the call index (yay explicit keys!) but introduces another problem — name clashes.</p>
<p>Granted, you probably won’t be tempted to call <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState(&#39;name&#39;)</code> twice in the same component except by mistake. This can happen accidentally but we could argue that about any bug. However, it’s quite likely that when you work on a <em>custom Hook</em>, you’ll want to add or remove state variables and effects.</p>
<p>With this proposal, any time you add a new state variable inside a custom Hook, you risk breaking any components that use it (directly or transitively) because <em>they might already use the same name</em> for their own state variables.</p>
<p>This is an example of an API that’s not <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/\\">optimized for change</a>. The current code might always look “elegant”, but it is very fragile to changes in requirements. We should <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html#mixins-cause-name-clashes\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">learn</a> from our mistakes.</p>
<p>The actual Hooks proposal solves this by relying on the call order: even if two Hooks use a <code class=\\"language-text\\">name</code> state variable, they would be isolated from each other. Every <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> call gets its own “memory cell”.</p>
<p>There are still a few other ways we could work around this flaw but they also have their own issues. Let’s explore this problem space more closely.</p>

<p>(I’ll admit this <code class=\\"language-text\\">useFormInput()</code> Hook isn’t particularly useful but you could imagine it handling things like validation and dirty state flag a la <a href=\\"https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Formik</a>.)</p>
<p>Can you spot the bug?</p>
<p>We’re calling <code class=\\"language-text\\">useFormInput()</code> twice but our <code class=\\"language-text\\">useFormInput()</code> always calls <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> with the same key. So effectively we’re doing something like:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>name<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> setName<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useState</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>valueKey<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>surname<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> setSurname<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useState</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>valueKey<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And this is how we get a clash again.</p>
<p>The actual Hooks proposal doesn’t have this problem because <strong>each <em>call</em> to <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> gets its own isolated state.</strong> Relying on a persistent call index frees us from worrying about name clashes.</p>

<p>This is a completely valid use case. <strong>It should be safe for a custom Hook author to start or stop using another custom Hook without worrying whether it is “already used” somewhere in the chain.</strong> In fact, <em>you can never know</em> the whole chain unless you audit every component using your Hook on every change.</p>
<p>(As a counterexample, the legacy React <code class=\\"language-text\\">createClass()</code> mixins did not let you do this. Sometimes you’d have two mixins that both do exactly what you need but are mutually incompatible due to extending the same “base” mixin.)</p>

<p>Maybe we could salvage the keyed state proposal by introducing some sort of namespacing. There are a few different ways to do it.</p>
<p>One way could be to isolate state keys with closures. This would require you to “instantiate” custom Hooks and add a function wrapper around each of them:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">/*******************

<p>This approach is rather heavy-handed. One of the design goals of Hooks is to avoid the deeply nested functional style that is prevalent with higher-order components and render props. Here, we have to “instantiate” <em>any</em> custom Hook before its use — and use the resulting function <em>exactly once</em> in the body of a component. This isn’t much simpler than calling Hooks unconditionally.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have to repeat every custom Hook used in a component twice. Once in the top level scope (or inside a function scope if we’re writing a custom Hook), and once at the actual call site. This means you have to jump between the rendering and top-level declarations even for small changes:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// ⚠️ This is NOT the React Hooks API</span>

<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You also need to be very precise with their names. You would always have “two levels” of names — factories like <code class=\\"language-text\\">createUseFormInput</code> and the instantiated Hooks like <code class=\\"language-text\\">useNameFormInput</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">useSurnameFormInput</code>.</p>
<p>If you call the same custom Hook “instance” twice you’d get a state clash. In fact, the code above has this mistake — have you noticed? It should be:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> name <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useNameFormInput</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> surname <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useSurnameFormInput</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span> <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Not useNameFormInput!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These problems are not insurmountable but I would argue that they add <em>more</em> friction than following the <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Rules of Hooks</a>.</p>
<p>Importantly, they break the expectations of copy-paste. Extracting a custom Hook without an extra closure wrapper <em>still works</em> with this approach but only until you call it twice. (Which is when it creates a conflict.) It’s unfortunate when an API seems to work but then forces you to Wrap All the Things™️ once you realize there is a conflict somewhere deep down the chain.</p>

<p>Out of different alternatives, I dislike this approach the least. I don’t think it’s worth it though.</p>
<p>Code passing non-unique or badly composed keys would <em>accidentally work</em> until a Hook is called multiple times or clashes with another Hook. Worse, if it’s meant to be conditional (we’re trying to “fix” the unconditional call requirement, right?), we might not even encounter the clashes until later.</p>
<p>Remembering to pass keys through all layers of custom Hooks seems fragile enough that we’d want to lint for that. They would add extra work at runtime (don’t forget they’d need to serve <em>as keys</em>), and each of them is a paper cut for bundle size. <strong>But if we have to lint anyway, what problem did we solve?</strong></p>
<p>This might make sense if conditionally declaring state and effects was very desirable. But in practice I find it confusing. In fact, I don’t recall anyone ever asking to conditionally define <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.state</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">componentDidMount</code> either.</p>
<p>What does this code mean exactly?</p>

<p>It definitely can’t run <em>before</em> <code class=\\"language-text\\">props.isActive</code> is <code class=\\"language-text\\">true</code> for the first time. But once it becomes <code class=\\"language-text\\">true</code>, does it ever stop running? Does the interval reset when <code class=\\"language-text\\">props.isActive</code> flips to <code class=\\"language-text\\">false</code>? If it does, it’s confusing that effect behaves differently from state (which we said wouldn’t reset). If the effect keeps running, it’s confusing that <code class=\\"language-text\\">if</code> outside the effect doesn’t actually make the effect conditional. Didn’t we say we wanted conditional effects?</p>
<p>If the state <em>does</em> get reset when we don’t “use” it during a render, what happens if multiple <code class=\\"language-text\\">if</code> branches contain <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState(&#39;count&#39;)</code> but only one runs at any given time? Is that valid code? If our mental model is a “map with keys”, why do things “disappear” from it? Would the developer expect an early <code class=\\"language-text\\">return</code> from a component to reset all state after it? If we truly wanted to reset the state, we could make it explicit by extracting a component:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Counter</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">if</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>isActive<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Clearly has its own state</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;</span>TickingCounter</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">/></span></span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">null</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That would probably become the “best practice” to avoid these confusing questions anyway. So whichever way you choose to answer them, I think the semantics of conditionally <em>declaring</em> state and effects itself end up weird enough that you might want to lint against it.</p>
<p>If we have to lint anyway, the requirement to correctly compose keys becomes “dead weight”. It doesn’t buy us anything we actually <em>want</em> to do. However, dropping that requirement (and going back to the original proposal) <em>does</em> buy us something. It makes copy-pasting component code into a custom Hook safe without namespacing it, reduces bundle size paper cuts from keys and unlocks a slightly more efficient implementation (no need for Map lookups).</p>
<p>Small things add up.</p>

<p>When you change the recipient, our <code class=\\"language-text\\">useFriendStatus()</code> Hook would unsubscribe from the previous friend’s status, and subscribe to the next one.</p>
<p>This works because we can pass the return value of the <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> Hook to the <code class=\\"language-text\\">useFriendStatus()</code> Hook:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">[</span>recipientID<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span> setRecipientID<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">]</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">useState</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token number\\">1</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

<p>Passing values between Hooks is very powerful.

<p>(Here’s a <a href=\\"https://codesandbox.io/s/ppxnl191zx\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">demo</a>.)</p>
<p>Proposals that put Hook initialization into default argument values or that write Hooks in a decorator form make it difficult to express this kind of logic.</p>
<p>If calling Hooks doesn’t happen in the function body, you can no longer easily pass values between them, transform those values without creating many layers of components, or add <code class=\\"language-text\\">useMemo()</code> to memoize an intermediate computation. You also can’t easily reference these values in effects because they can’t capture them in a closure. There are ways to work around these issues with some convention but they require you to mentally “match up” inputs and outputs. This is tricky and violates React’s otherwise direct style.</p>
<p>Passing values between Hooks is at the heart of our proposal. Render props pattern was the closest you could get to it without Hooks, but you couldn’t get full benefits without something like <a href=\\"https://ui.reach.tech/component-component\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Component Component</a> which has a lot of syntactic noise due to a “false hierarchy”. Hooks flatten that hierarchy to passing values — and function calls is the simplest way to do that.</p>

<p>There are many proposals that fall under this umbrella. Most attempt to avoid the perceived dependency of Hooks on React. There is a wide variety of ways to do it: by making built-in Hooks available on <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code>, making them an extra argument you have to pass through everything, and so on.</p>
<p>I think <a href=\\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68#issuecomment-439314884\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Sebastian’s answer</a> addresses this way better than I could describe so I encourage you to check out its first section (“Injection Model”).</p>
<p>I’ll just say there is a reason programmers tend to prefer <code class=\\"language-text\\">try</code> / <code class=\\"language-text\\">catch</code> for error handling to passing error codes through every function. It’s the same reason why we prefer ES Modules with <code class=\\"language-text\\">import</code> (or CommonJS <code class=\\"language-text\\">require</code>) to AMD’s “explicit” definitions where <code class=\\"language-text\\">require</code> is passed to us.</p>

<p>Yes, AMD may be more “honest” to the fact that modules aren’t actually synchronously loaded in a browser environment. But once you learn about that, writing the <code class=\\"language-text\\">define</code> sandwich becomes a mindless chore.</p>
<p><code class=\\"language-text\\">try</code> / <code class=\\"language-text\\">catch</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">require</code>, and React Context API are pragmatic examples of how we want to have some “ambient” handler available to us instead of explicitly threading it through every level — even if in general we value explicitness. I think the same is true for Hooks.</p>
<p>This is similar to how, when we define components, we just grab <code class=\\"language-text\\">Component</code> from <code class=\\"language-text\\">React</code>. Maybe our code would be more decoupled from React if we exported a factory for every component instead:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">createModal</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>React<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">class</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Modal</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">extends</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">React<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But in practice this ends up being just an annoying indirection. When we actually want to stub React with something else, we can always do that at the module system level instead.</p>
<p>The same applies to Hooks. Still, as <a href=\\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68#issuecomment-439314884\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Sebastian’s answer</a> mentions, it is <em>technically possible</em> to “redirect” Hooks exported from <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> to a different implementation. (<a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/how-does-setstate-know-what-to-do/\\">One of my previous posts</a> mentions how.)</p>
<p>Another way to impose more ceremony is by making Hooks <a href=\\"https://paulgray.net/an-alternative-design-for-hooks/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">monadic</a> or adding a first-class concept like <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.createHook()</code>. Aside from the runtime overhead, any solution that adds wrappers loses a huge benefit of using plain functions: <em>they are as easy to debug as it gets</em>.</p>
<p>Plain functions let you step in and out with a debugger without any library code in the middle, and see exactly how values flow inside your component body. Indirections make this difficult. Solutions similar in spirit to either higher-order components (“decorator” Hooks) or render props (e.g. <code class=\\"language-text\\">adopt</code> proposal or <code class=\\"language-text\\">yield</code>ing from generators) suffer from the same problem. Indirections also complicate static typing.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this post doesn’t aim to be exhaustive. There are other interesting problems with different proposals. Some of them are more obscure (e.g. related to concurrency or advanced compilation techniques) and might be a topic for another blog post in the future.</p>
<p>Hooks aren’t perfect either, but it’s the best tradeoff we could find for solving these problems. There are things we <a href=\\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68#issuecomment-440780509\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">still need to fix</a>, and there exist things that are more awkward with Hooks than classes. That is also a topic for another blog post.</p>
<p>Whether I covered your favorite alternative proposal or not, I hope this writeup helped shed some light on our thinking process and the criteria we consider when choosing an API. As you can see, a lot of it (such as making sure that copy-pasting, moving code, adding and removing dependencies works as expected) has to do with <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/\\">optimizing for change</a>. I hope that React users will appreciate these aspects.</p>

<p><em>Good</em> API design is memorable and unambiguous. It encourages readable, correct and performant code, and helps developers fall into <a href=\\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">the pit of success</a>.</p>
<p>I call these design aspects “first order” because they are the first things a library developer tends to focus on. You might have to compromise on some of them and make tradeoffs but at least they’re always on your mind.</p>
<p>However, unless you’re sending a rover to Mars, your code will probably change over time. And so will the code of your API consumers.</p>
<p>The best API designers I know don’t stop at the “first order” aspects like readability. They dedicate just as much, if not more, effort to what I call the “second order” API design: <strong>how code using this API would evolve over time.</strong></p>
<p>A slight change in requirements can make the most elegant code fall apart.</p>
<p><em>Great</em> APIs anticipate that. They anticipate that you’ll want to move some code. Copy and paste some part. Rename it. Unify special cases into a generic reusable helper. Unwind an abstraction back into specific cases. Add a hack. Optimize a bottleneck. Throw away a part and start it anew. Make a mistake. Navigate between the cause and the effect. Fix a bug. Review the fix.</p>
<p>Great APIs not only let you fall into a pit of success, but help you <em>stay</em> there.</p>
<p>They’re optimized for change.</p>

<p>Sure, React re-renders the component with the next <code class=\\"language-text\\">{ clicked: true }</code> state and updates the DOM to match the returned <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;h1&gt;Thanks&lt;/h1&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>Seems straightforward. But wait, does <em>React</em> do it? Or <em>React DOM</em>?</p>
<p>Updating the DOM sounds like something React DOM would be responsible for. But we’re calling <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code>, not something from React DOM. And our <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> base class is defined inside React itself.</p>
<p>So how can <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState()</code> inside <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> update the DOM?</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: Just like <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/why-do-react-elements-have-typeof-property/\\">most</a> <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/how-does-react-tell-a-class-from-a-function/\\">other</a> <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/why-do-we-write-super-props/\\">posts</a> on this blog, you don’t actually <em>need</em> to know any of that to be productive with React. This post is for those who like to see what’s behind the curtain. Completely optional!</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>We might think that the <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> class contains DOM update logic.</p>
<p>But if that were the case, how can <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code> work in other environments? For example, components in React Native apps also extend <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code>. They call <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code> just like we did above, and yet React Native works with Android and iOS native views instead of the DOM.</p>
<p>You might also be familiar with React Test Renderer or Shallow Renderer. Both of these testing strategies let you render normal components and call <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code> inside them. But neither of them works with the DOM.</p>
<p>If you used renderers like <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-art\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">React ART</a>, you might also know that it’s possible to use more than one renderer on the page. (For example, ART components work inside a React DOM tree.) This makes a global flag or variable untenable.</p>
<p>So somehow <strong><code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> delegates handling state updates to the platform-specific code.</strong> Before we can understand how this happens, let’s dig deeper into how packages are separated and why.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a common misconception that the React “engine” lives inside the <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> package. This is not true.</p>
<p>In fact, ever since the <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/07/03/react-v0.14-beta-1.html#two-packages\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">package split in React 0.14</a>, the <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> package intentionally only exposes APIs for <em>defining</em> components. Most of the <em>implementation</em> of React lives in the “renderers”.</p>
<p><code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom/server</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-native</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-test-renderer</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-art</code> are some examples of renderers (and you can <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-reconciler/README.md#practical-examples\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">build your own</a>).</p>
<p>This is why the <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> package is useful regardless of which platform you target. All its exports, such as <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.createElement</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Children</code> utilities and (eventually) <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Hooks</a>, are independent of the target platform. Whether you run React DOM, React DOM Server, or React Native, your components would import and use them in the same way.</p>
<p>In contrast, the renderer packages expose platform-specific APIs like <code class=\\"language-text\\">ReactDOM.render()</code> that let you mount a React hierarchy into a DOM node. Each renderer provides an API like this. Ideally, most <em>components</em> shouldn’t need to import anything from a renderer. This keeps them more portable.</p>
<p><strong>What most people imagine as the React “engine” is inside each individual renderer.</strong> Many renderers include a copy of the same code — we call it the <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-reconciler\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">“reconciler”</a>. A <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/12/15/improving-the-repository-infrastructure.html#migrating-to-google-closure-compiler\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">build step</a> smooshes the reconciler code together with the renderer code into a single highly optimized bundle for better performance. (Copying code is usually not great for bundle size but the vast majority of React users only needs one renderer at a time, such as <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code>.)</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that the <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> package only lets you <em>use</em> React features but doesn’t know anything about <em>how</em> they’re implemented. The renderer packages (<code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-native</code>, etc) provide the implementation of React features and platform-specific logic. Some of that code is shared (“reconciler”) but that’s an implementation detail of individual renderers.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now we know why <em>both</em> <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code> packages need to be updated for new features. For example, when React 16.3 added the Context API, <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.createContext()</code> was exposed on the React package.</p>
<p>But <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.createContext()</code> doesn’t actually <em>implement</em> the context feature. The implementation would need to be different between React DOM and React DOM Server, for example. So <code class=\\"language-text\\">createContext()</code> returns a few plain objects:</p>

<p>When you use <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;MyContext.Provider&gt;</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;MyContext.Consumer&gt;</code> in the code, it’s the <em>renderer</em> that decides how to handle them. React DOM might track context values in one way, but React DOM Server might do it differently.</p>
<p><strong>So if you update <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> to 16.3+ but don’t update <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code>, you’d be using a renderer that isn’t yet aware of the special <code class=\\"language-text\\">Provider</code> and <code class=\\"language-text\\">Consumer</code> types.</strong> This is why an older <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code> would <a href=\\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/49677020/458193\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">fail saying these types are invalid</a>.</p>
<p>The same caveat applies to React Native. However, unlike React DOM, a React release doesn’t immediately “force” a React Native release. They have an independent release schedule. The updated renderer code is <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits/master/Libraries/Renderer/oss\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">separately synced</a> into the React Native repository once in a few weeks. This is why features become available in React Native on a different schedule than in React DOM.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, so now we know that the <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> package doesn’t contain anything interesting, and the implementation lives in renderers like <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-native</code>, and so on. But that doesn’t answer our question. How does <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState()</code> inside <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> “talk” to the right renderer?</p>
<p><strong>The answer is that every renderer sets a special field on the created class.</strong> This field is called <code class=\\"language-text\\">updater</code>. It’s not something <em>you</em> would set — rather, it’s something React DOM, React DOM Server or React Native set right after creating an instance of your class:</p>

<p>And this is how <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code> can update the DOM even though it’s defined in the React package. It reads <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.updater</code> which was set by React DOM, and lets React DOM schedule and handle the update.</p>
<hr>
<p>We know about classes now, but what about Hooks?</p>
<p>When people first look at the <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Hooks proposal API</a>, they often wonder: how does <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState</code> “know what to do”? The assumption is that it’s more “magical” than a base <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> class with <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code>.</p>
<p>But as we have seen today, the base class <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState()</code> implementation has been an illusion all along. It doesn’t do anything except forwarding the call to the current renderer. And <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState</code> Hook <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react/src/ReactHooks.js#L55-L56\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">does exactly the same thing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of an <code class=\\"language-text\\">updater</code> field, Hooks use a “dispatcher” object.</strong> When you call <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.useState()</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.useEffect()</code>, or another built-in Hook, these calls are forwarded to the current dispatcher.</p>

<p>And individual renderers set the dispatcher before rendering your component:</p>

<p>For example, the React DOM Server implementation is <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactPartialRendererHooks.js#L340-L354\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">here</a>, and the reconciler implementation shared by React DOM and React Native is <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is why a renderer such as <code class=\\"language-text\\">react-dom</code> needs to access the same <code class=\\"language-text\\">react</code> package that you call Hooks from. Otherwise, your component won’t “see” the dispatcher! This may not work when you have <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">multiple copies of React</a> in the same component tree. However, this has always led to obscure bugs so Hooks force you to solve the package duplication before it costs you.</p>
<p>While we don’t encourage this, you can technically override the dispatcher yourself for advanced tooling use cases. (I lied about  <code class=\\"language-text\\">__currentDispatcher</code> name but you can find the real one in the React repo.) For example, React DevTools will use <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ce43a8cd07c355647922480977b46713bd51883e/packages/react-debug-tools/src/ReactDebugHooks.js#L203-L214\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">a special purpose-built dispatcher</a> to introspect the Hooks tree by capturing JavaScript stack traces. <em>Don’t repeat this at home.</em></p>
<p>This also means Hooks aren’t inherently tied to React. If in the future more libraries want to reuse the same primitive Hooks, in theory the dispatcher could move to a separate package and be exposed as a first-class API with a less “scary” name. In practice, we’d prefer to avoid premature abstraction until there is a need for it.</p>
<p>Both the <code class=\\"language-text\\">updater</code> field and the <code class=\\"language-text\\">__currentDispatcher</code> object are forms of a generic programming principle called <em>dependency injection</em>. In both cases, the renderers “inject” implementations of features like <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code> into the generic React package to keep your components more declarative.</p>
<p>You don’t need to think about how this works when you use React. We’d like React users to spend more time thinking about their application code than abstract concepts like dependency injection. But if you’ve ever wondered how <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState()</code> know what to do, I hope this helps.</p>

<p>My first exposure to the idea of changing code on the fly was a brief mention in a book about Erlang that I read as a teenager. Much later, like many others, I fell in love with <a href=\\"https://vimeo.com/36579366\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Bret Victor’s beautiful demos</a>. I’ve read somewhere Bret was unhappy with people cherry-picking “easy” parts of his demos and screwing up the big vision. (I don’t know if this is true.) <strong>In either case, to me shipping even small incremental improvements that people take for granted later is a success.</strong> Smarter people than me will work on Next Big Ideas.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be clear that none of the <em>ideas</em> discussed in this post are mine. I’ve been <a href=\\"https://redux.js.org/introduction/prior-art\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">inspired</a> by many projects and people. In fact, even people whose projects I’ve never tried occasionally told me I’ve ripped off their stuff.</p>
<p>I’m not an inventor. If I have a “principle”, it is to take a vision that inspires me, and share it with more people — through words, code, and demos.</p>
<p>And hot reloading inspires me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve taken several attempts at implementing hot reloading for React.</p>
<p>In retrospect, <a href=\\"https://vimeo.com/100010922\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">the first demo</a> I cobbled together changed my life. It got me my first Twitter followers, first thousand GitHub stars, later first <a href=\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8982620\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">HN frontpage</a> hit, and even my first <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">conference talk</a> (bringing Redux into existence, oops). This first iteration worked fairly well. However, soon React moved <em>away</em> from <code class=\\"language-text\\">createClass</code>, making a reliable implementation much more difficult.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve done <a href=\\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/hot-reloading-in-react-1140438583bf?source=user_profile---------6------------------\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">a few more attempts</a> to fix it, each flawed in a different way. One of them is still being used in React Native (hot reloading functions doesn’t work there because of my mistakes — sorry!)</p>
<p>Frustrated with my inability to work around some issues and the lack of time, I handed React Hot Loader over to a few talented contributors. They have been pushing it forward and found clever workarounds for my design flaws. I am grateful to them for keeping the project in a good state despite the challenges.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>To be clear, hot reloading in React is quite usable today.</strong> In fact, this blog uses Gatsby which uses React Hot Loader under the hood. I save this post in my editor and it updates without refreshing. Magic! In some ways, the vision that I worried wouldn’t ever see mainstream usage is already almost boring.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of people who feel it isn’t as good as it could be. Some dismiss it as a gimmick and that breaks my heart a little bit, but I think what they’re really saying is: <strong>the experience is not seamless.</strong> It’s not worth it if you’re never sure whether a hot reload worked, if it breaks in confusing ways, or if it’s easier to just refresh. I agree with this 100%, but to me it means we have more work to do. And I’m excited to start thinking about what official React support for hot reloading could look like in the future.</p>
<p>(If you use a language like Elm, Reason or ClojureScript, maybe those problems are already solved in your ecosystem. I’m happy that you’re happy. This won’t stop me from trying and failing to bring good stuff to JavaScript.)</p>
<hr>
<p>I think I’m ready to take another attempt at implementing it. Here’s why.</p>
<p>Ever since <code class=\\"language-text\\">createClass</code> stopped being the primary way we define components, <strong>the biggest source of complexity and fragility in hot reloading components was dynamically replacing class methods.</strong> How do you patch existing instances of classes with new “versions” of their methods? The simple answer is “replace them on the prototype” but even with Proxies, in my experience there are too many gnarly edge cases for this to work reliably.</p>
<p>By comparison, hot reloading functions is easy. A Babel plugin could split any function component exported from a module into two functions:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Reassigns the latest version</span>
window<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function-variable function\\">latest_Button</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Your actual code is moved here by a plugin</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;</span>button</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token plain-text\\">Hello</span><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>

<span class=\\"token comment\\">// Think of this as a \\"proxy\\"</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// that other components would use</span>
<span class=\\"token keyword\\">export</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">default</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Button</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Always points to latest version</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> window<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">latest_Button</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Every time this module re-executes after an edit, <code class=\\"language-text\\">window.latest_Button</code> would point to the latest implementation. Reusing the same <code class=\\"language-text\\">Button</code> function between module evaluations would let us trick React into not unmounting our component even though we swapped out the implementation.</p>
<p>For a long time, it seemed to me that implementing reliable hot reloading for functions <em>alone</em> would encourage people to write convoluted code just to avoid using classes. But with <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">Hooks</a>, function components are fully featured so this is not a concern anymore.

<p>As long as the Hook call order doesn’t change, we can preserve the state even as <code class=\\"language-text\\">window.latest_Button</code> is replaced between file edits. And replacing event handlers “just works” too — because Hooks rely on closures, and we replace the whole function.</p>
<hr>
<p>This was just a rough sketch of one possible approach. There are more (some are very different). How do we evaluate and compare them?</p>
<p>Before I get too attached to a specific approach that might be flawed in some way, <strong>I decided to write down a few principles that I think are important for judging any hot reloading implementation for component code.</strong></p>
<p>It would be nice to express some of these principles as tests later. These rules aren’t strict and there might be reasonable compromises. But if we decide to break them, that should be an explicit design decision and not something we accidentally discover later.</p>
<p>Here goes my wish list for hot reloading React components:</p>
<h3 id=\\"correctness\\"><a href=\\"#correctness\\" aria-hidden class=\\"anchor\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\"true\\" height=\\"16\\" version=\\"1.1\\" viewBox=\\"0 0 16 16\\" width=\\"16\\"><path fill-rule=\\"evenodd\\" d=\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\"></path></svg></a>Correctness</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hot reloading should be unobservable before the first edit.</strong> Until you save a file, the code should behave exactly as it would if hot reloading was disabled. It’s expected that things like <code class=\\"language-text\\">fn.toString()</code> don’t match, which is already the case with minification. But it shouldn’t break reasonable application and library logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hot reload shouldn’t break React rules.</strong> Components shouldn’t get their lifecycles called in an unexpected way, accidentally swap state between unrelated trees, or do other non-Reacty things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Element type should always match the expected type.</strong> Some approaches wrap component types but this can break <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;MyThing /&gt;.type === MyThing</code>. This is a common source of bugs and should not happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It should be easy to support all React types.</strong> <code class=\\"language-text\\">lazy</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">memo</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">forwardRef</code> — they should all be supported and it shouldn’t be hard to add support for more. Nested variations like <code class=\\"language-text\\">memo(memo(...))</code> should also work. We should always remount when the type shape changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It shouldn’t reimplement a non-trivial chunk of React.</strong> It’s hard to keep up with React. If a solution reimplements React it poses problems in longer term as React adds features like Suspense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-exports shouldn’t break.</strong> If a component re-exports components from other modules (whether own or from <code class=\\"language-text\\">node_modules</code>), that shouldn’t cause issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Static fields shouldn’t break.</strong> If you define a <code class=\\"language-text\\">ProfilePage.onEnter</code> method, you’d expect an importing module to be able to read it. Sometimes libraries rely on this so it’s important that it’s possible to read and write static properties, and for component itself to “see” the same values on itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is better to lose local state than to behave incorrectly.</strong> If we can’t reliably patch something (for example, a class), it is better to lose its local state than to do a mixed success effort at updating it. The developer will be suspicious anyway and likely force a refresh. We should be intentional about which cases we’re confident we can handle, and discard the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is better to lose local state than use an old version.</strong> This is a more specific variation of the previous principle. For example, if a class couldn’t be hot reloaded, the code should force a remount for those components with the new version rather than keep rendering a zombie.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Editing a module should re-execute as few modules as possible.</strong> Side effects during component module initialization are generally discouraged. But the more code you execute, the more likely something will cause a mess when called twice. We’re writing JavaScript, and React components are islands of (relative) purity but even there we don’t have strong guarantees. So if I edit a module, my hot reloading solution should re-execute that module and try to stop there if possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Editing a component shouldn’t destroy the state of its parents or siblings.</strong> Similar to how <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState()</code> only affects the tree below, editing a component shouldn’t affect anything above it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edits to non-React code should propagate upwards.</strong> If you edit a file with constants or pure functions that’s imported from several components, those components should update. It is acceptable to lose module state in such files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A runtime error introduced during hot reloading should not propagate.</strong> If you make a mistake in one component, it shouldn’t break your whole app. In React, this is usually solved by error boundaries. However, they are too coarse for the countless typos we make while editing. I should be able to make and fix runtime errors while I work on a component without its siblings or parents unmounting. However, errors that <em>don’t</em> happen during hot reload (and are legitimate bugs in my code) should go to the closest error boundary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preserve own state unless it’s clear the developer doesn’t want to.</strong> If you’re just tweaking styles, it’s frustrating for the state to reset on every edit. On the other hand, if you just changed the state shape or the initial state, you’ll often prefer it to reset. By default we should try our best to preserve state. But if it leads to an error during hot reload, this is often a sign some assumption has changed, so we should reset state and <em>retry</em> rendering in that case. Commenting things out and back in is common so it’s important to handle that gracefully. For example, removing Hooks <em>at the end</em> shouldn’t reset state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discard state when it’s clear the developer wants to.</strong> In some cases we can also proactively detect that the user wants to reset. For example, if the Hook order changed, or if primitive Hooks like <code class=\\"language-text\\">useState</code> change their initial state type. We can also offer a lightweight annotation that you can use to force a component to reset on every edit. Such as <code class=\\"language-text\\">// !</code> or some similar convention that’s fast to add and remove while you focus on how component mounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support updating “fixed” things.</strong> If a component is wrapped in <code class=\\"language-text\\">memo()</code>, hot reload should still update it. If an effect is called with <code class=\\"language-text\\">[]</code>, it should still be replaced. Code is like an invisible variable. Previously, I thought it was important to force deep updates below for things like <code class=\\"language-text\\">renderRow={this.renderRow}</code>. But in the Hooks world, we rely on closures anyway this seems unnecessary anymore. A different reference should be sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support multiple components in one file.</strong> It is a common pattern that multiple components are defined in the same file. Even if we only keep the state for function components, we want to make sure putting them in one file doesn’t cause them to lose state. Note these can be mutually recursive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When possible, preserve the state of children.</strong> If you edit a component, it’s always frustrating if its children unintentionally lose state. As long as the element types of children are defined in other files, we expect their state to be preserved. If they’re in the same file, we should do our best effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support custom Hooks.</strong> For well-written custom Hooks (some cases like <code class=\\"language-text\\">useInterval()</code> can be a bit tricky), hot reloading any arguments (including functions) should work. This shouldn’t need extra work and follows from the design of Hooks. Our solution just shouldn’t get in the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support render props.</strong> This usually doesn’t pose problems but it’s worth verifying they work and get updated as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support higher-order components.</strong> Wrapping export into a higher-order component like <code class=\\"language-text\\">connect</code> shouldn’t break hot reloading or state preservation. If you use a component created from a HOC in JSX (such as <code class=\\"language-text\\">styled</code>), and that component is a class, it’s expected that it loses state when instantiated in the edited file. But a HOC that returns a function component (potentially using Hooks) shouldn’t lose state even if it’s defined in the same file. In fact, even edits to its arguments (e.g. <code class=\\"language-text\\">mapStateToProps</code>) should be reflected.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Both success and failure should provide visual feedback.</strong> You should always be confident whether a hot reload succeeded or failed. In case of a runtime or a syntax error you should see an overlay which should be automatically be dismissed after it is irrelevant. When hot reload is successful, there should be some visual feedback such as flashing updated components or a notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A syntax error shouldn’t cause a runtime error or a refresh.</strong> When you edit the code and you have a syntax error, it should be shown in a modal overlay (ideally, with a click-through to the editor). If you make another syntax error, the existing overlay is updated. Hot reloading is only attempted <em>after</em> you fix your syntax errors. Syntax error shouldn’t make you lose the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A syntax error after reload should still be visible.</strong> If you see a modal syntax error overlay and refresh, you should still be seeing it. It categorically should not let you run the last successful version (I’ve seen that in some setups).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider exposing power user tools.</strong> With hot reloading, code itself can be your “terminal”. In addition to the hypothetical <code class=\\"language-text\\">// !</code> command to force remount, there could be e.g. an <code class=\\"language-text\\">// inspect</code> command that shows a panel with props values next to the component. Be creative!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize the noise.</strong> DevTools and warning messages shouldn’t expose that we’re doing something special. Avoid breaking <code class=\\"language-text\\">displayName</code>s or adding useless wrappers to the debug output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debugging in major browsers should show the most recent code.</strong> While this doesn’t exactly depend on us, we should do our best to ensure the browser debugger shows the most recent version of any file and that breakpoints work as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize for fast iteration, not long refactoring.</strong> This is JavaScript, not Elm. Any long-running series of edits likely won’t hot reload well due to a bunch of mistakes that need to be fixed one by one. When in doubt, optimize for the use case of tweaking a few components in a tight iteration loop rather than for a big refactor. And be predictable. Keep in mind that if you lose developer’s trust they’ll refresh anyway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This was my wish list for how hot reloading in React — or any component system that offers more than templates — should work. There’s probably more stuff I will add here with time.</p>
<p>I don’t know how many of these goals we can satisfy with JavaScript. But there’s one more reason I’m looking forward to working on hot reloading again. As an engineer I’m more organized than before. In particular, <strong>I’ve finally learned my lesson to write up requirements like this before diving into another implementation.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe this one will actually work! But if it doesn’t, at least I’ve left some breadcrumbs for the next person who tries it.</p>

<p>If you used React you might be familiar with <code class=\\"language-text\\">type</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">props</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">key</code>, and <code class=\\"language-text\\">ref</code> fields. <strong>But what is <code class=\\"language-text\\">$$typeof</code>?

<p>That’s another one of those things that you don’t <em>need</em> to know to use React, but that will make you feel good when you do. There’s also some tips about security in this post that you might want to know. Maybe one day you’ll write your own UI library and all of this will come in handy. I certainly hope so.</p>

<p>Before client-side UI libraries became common and added basic protection, it was common for app code to construct HTML and insert it into the DOM:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> messageEl <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> document<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">getElementById</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token string\\">'message'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
messageEl<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>innerHTML <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">'&lt;p>'</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">+</span> message<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>text <span class=\\"token operator\\">+</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">'&lt;/p>'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That works fine, except when your <code class=\\"language-text\\">message.text</code> is something like <code class=\\"language-text\\">&#39;&lt;img src onerror=&quot;stealYourPassword()&quot;&gt;&#39;</code>. <strong>You don’t want things written by strangers to appear verbatim in your app’s rendered HTML.</strong></p>
<p>(Fun fact: if you only do client-side rendering, a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag here wouldn’t let you run JavaScript. But <a href=\\"https://gomakethings.com/preventing-cross-site-scripting-attacks-when-using-innerhtml-in-vanilla-javascript/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">don’t let this</a> lull you into a false sense of security.)</p>
<p>To protect against such attacks, you can use safe APIs like <code class=\\"language-text\\">document.createTextNode()</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">textContent</code> that only deal with text. You can also preemptively “escape” inputs by replacing potentially dangerous characters like <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">&gt;</code> and others in any user-provided text.</p>
<p>Still, the cost of a mistake is high and it’s a hassle to remember it every time you interpolate a user-written string into your output. <strong>This is why modern libraries like React escape text content for strings by default:</strong></p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token plain-text\\">
  </span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>message<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>text<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token plain-text\\">
</span><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If <code class=\\"language-text\\">message.text</code> is a malicious string with an <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;img&gt;</code> or another tag, it won’t turn into a real <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. React will escape the content and <em>then</em> insert it into the DOM. So instead of seeing the <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag you’ll just see its markup.</p>
<p>To render arbitrary HTML inside a React element, you have to write <code class=\\"language-text\\">dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: message.text }}</code>. <strong>The fact that it’s clumsy to write is a <em>feature</em>.</strong> It’s meant to be highly visible so that you can catch it in code reviews and codebase audits.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Does it mean React is entirely safe from injection attacks? No.</strong> HTML and DOM offer <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3473#issuecomment-90594748\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">plenty of attack surface</a> that is too difficult or slow for React or other UI libraries to mitigate against. Most of the remaining attack vectors involve attributes. For example, if you render <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;a href={user.website}&gt;</code>, beware of the user whose website is <code class=\\"language-text\\">&#39;javascript: stealYourPassword()&#39;</code>. Spreading user input like <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;div {...userData}&gt;</code> is rare but also dangerous.</p>
<p>React <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10506\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">could</a> provide more protection over time but in many cases these are consequences of server issues that <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3473#issuecomment-91327040\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">should</a> be fixed there anyway.</p>
<p>Still, escaping text content is a reasonable first line of defence that catches a lot of potential attacks. Isn’t it nice to know that code like this is safe?</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Escaped automatically</span>

<p><strong>Well, that wasn’t always true either.</strong> And that’s where <code class=\\"language-text\\">$$typeof</code> comes in.</p>
<hr>
<p>React elements are plain objects by design:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>While normally you create them with <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.createElement()</code>, it is not required. There are valid use cases for React to support plain element objects written like I just did above. Of course, you probably wouldn’t <em>want</em> to write them like this — but this <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3583#issuecomment-90296667\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">can be</a> useful for an optimizing compiler, passing UI elements between workers, or for decoupling JSX from the React package.</p>
<p>However, <strong>if your server has a hole that lets the user store an arbitrary JSON object</strong> while the client code expects a string, this could become a problem:</p>

<span class=\\"token comment\\">// Dangerous in React 0.13</span>

<p>In that case, React 0.13 would be <a href=\\"http://danlec.com/blog/xss-via-a-spoofed-react-element\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">vulnerable</a> to an XSS attack. To clarify, again, <strong>this attack depends on an existing server hole</strong>. Still, React could do a better job of protecting people against it. And starting with React 0.14, it does.</p>
<p>The fix in React 0.14 was to <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4832\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">tag every React element with a Symbol</a>:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  type<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">:</span> <span class=\\"token string\\">'marquee'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">,</span>

<p>This works because you can’t just put <code class=\\"language-text\\">Symbol</code>s in JSON. <strong>So even if the server has a security hole and returns JSON instead of text, that JSON can’t include <code class=\\"language-text\\">Symbol.for(&#39;react.element&#39;)</code>.</strong> React will check <code class=\\"language-text\\">element.$$typeof</code>, and will refuse to process the element if it’s missing or invalid.</p>
<p>The nice thing about using <code class=\\"language-text\\">Symbol.for()</code> specifically is that <strong>Symbols are global between environments like iframes and workers.</strong> So this fix doesn’t prevent passing trusted elements between different parts of the app even in more exotic conditions. Similarly, even if there are multiple copies of React on the page, they can still “agree” on the valid <code class=\\"language-text\\">$$typeof</code> value.</p>
<hr>
<p>What about the browsers that <a href=\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Browser_compatibility\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">don’t support</a> Symbols?</p>
<p>Alas, they don’t get this extra protection. React still includes the <code class=\\"language-text\\">$$typeof</code> field on the element for consistency, but it’s <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8482cbe22d1a421b73db602e1f470c632b09f693/packages/shared/ReactSymbols.js#L14-L16\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">set to a number</a> — <code class=\\"language-text\\">0xeac7</code>.</p>
<p>Why this number specifically? <code class=\\"language-text\\">0xeac7</code> kinda looks like “React”.</p>

<p>(Until <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">recently</a>, that was the only way to use features like state.)</p>
<p>When you want to render a <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;Greeting /&gt;</code>, you don’t care how it’s defined:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Class or function — whatever.</span>

<p>But <em>React itself</em> cares about the difference!</p>
<p>If <code class=\\"language-text\\">Greeting</code> is a function, React needs to call it:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Your code</span>
<span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Greeting</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>

<span class=\\"token comment\\">// Inside React</span>
<span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> result <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Greeting</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span> <span class=\\"token comment\\">// &lt;p>Hello&lt;/p></span></code></pre></div>
<p>But if <code class=\\"language-text\\">Greeting</code> is a class, React needs to instantiate it with the <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> operator and <em>then</em> call the <code class=\\"language-text\\">render</code> method on the just created instance:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Your code</span>

<p>In both cases React’s goal is to get the rendered node (in this example, <code class=\\"language-text\\">&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;</code>). But the exact steps depend on how <code class=\\"language-text\\">Greeting</code> is defined.</p>
<p><strong>So how does React know if something is a class or a function?</strong></p>
<p>Just like in my <a href=\\"https://overreacted.io/why-do-we-write-super-props/\\">previous post</a>, <strong>you don’t <em>need</em> to know this to be productive in React.</strong> I didn’t know this for years. Please don’t turn this into an interview question. In fact, this post is more about JavaScript than it is about React.</p>
<p>This blog is for a curious reader who wants to know <em>why</em> React works in a certain way. Are you that person? Then let’s dig in together.</p>
<p><strong>This is a long journey. Buckle up. This post doesn’t have much information about React itself, but we’ll go through some aspects of <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">class</code>, arrow functions, <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">instanceof</code>, and how those things work together in JavaScript. Luckily, you don’t need to think about those as much when you <em>use</em> React. If you’re implementing React though…</strong></p>
<p>(If you really just want to know the answer, scroll to the very end.)</p>
<hr>
<p>First, we need to understand why it’s important to treat functions and classes differently. Note how we use the <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> operator when calling a class:</p>

<p>Let’s get a rough sense of what the <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> operator does in JavaScript.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the old days, JavaScript did not have classes. However, you could express a similar pattern to classes using plain functions. <strong>Concretely, you can use <em>any</em> function in a role similar to a class constructor by adding <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> before its call:</strong></p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Just a function</span>

<p>You can still write code like this today! Try it in DevTools.</p>
<p>If you called <code class=\\"language-text\\">Person(&#39;Fred&#39;)</code> <strong>without</strong> <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> inside it would point to something global and useless (for example, <code class=\\"language-text\\">window</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">undefined</code>). So our code would crash or do something silly like setting <code class=\\"language-text\\">window.name</code>.</p>
<p>By adding <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> before the call, we say: “Hey JavaScript, I know <code class=\\"language-text\\">Person</code> is just a function but let’s pretend it’s something like a class constructor. <strong>Create an <code class=\\"language-text\\">{}</code> object and point <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> inside the <code class=\\"language-text\\">Person</code> function to that object so I can assign stuff like <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.name</code>. Then give that object back to me.</strong>”</p>
<p>That’s what the <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> operator does.</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">var</span> fred <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">new</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Person</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token string\\">'Fred'</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span> <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Same object as \`this\` inside \`Person\`</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is how people emulated classes before JavaScript added them directly.</p>
<hr>
<p>So <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> has been around in JavaScript for a while. However, classes are more recent. They let us rewrite the code above to match our intent more closely:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">class</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Person</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p><em>Capturing developer’s intent</em> is important in language and API design.</p>
<p>If you write a function, JavaScript can’t guess if it’s meant to be called like <code class=\\"language-text\\">alert()</code> or if it serves as a constructor like <code class=\\"language-text\\">new Person()</code>. Forgetting to specify <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> for a function like <code class=\\"language-text\\">Person</code> would lead to confusing behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Class syntax lets us say: “This isn’t just a function — it’s a class and it has a constructor”.</strong> If you forget <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> when calling it, JavaScript will raise an error:</p>

<p>However, it means that React needs to put <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> before calling any class. It can’t just call it as a regular function, as JavaScript would treat it as an error!</p>

<p>This spells trouble.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before we see how React solves this, it’s important to remember most people using React use compilers like Babel to compile away modern features like classes for older browsers. So we need to consider compilers in our design.</p>
<p>In early versions of Babel, classes could be called without <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>. However, this was fixed — by generating some extra code:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Person</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>name<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<p>You might have seen code like this in your bundle. That’s what all those <code class=\\"language-text\\">_classCallCheck</code> functions do. (You can reduce the bundle size by opting into the “loose mode” with no checks but this might complicate your eventual transition to real native classes.)</p>
<hr>
<p>By now, you should roughly understand the difference between calling something with <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> or without <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>:</p>

<p>This is why it’s important for React to call your component correctly. <strong>If your component is defined as a class, React needs to use <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> when calling it.</strong></p>
<p>So can React just check if something is a class or not?</p>
<p>Not so easy! Even if we could <a href=\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29093396/how-do-you-check-the-difference-between-an-ecmascript-6-class-and-function\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">tell a class from a function in JavaScript</a>, this still wouldn’t work for classes processed by tools like Babel. To the browser, they’re just plain functions. Tough luck for React.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, so maybe React could just use <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> on every call? Unfortunately, that doesn’t always work either.</p>
<p>With regular functions, calling them with <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> would give them an object instance as <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code>. It’s desirable for functions written as constructor (like our <code class=\\"language-text\\">Person</code> above), but it would be confusing for function components:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Greeting</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// We wouldn’t expect \`this\` to be any kind of instance here</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">return</span> <span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token plain-text\\">Hello</span><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That could be tolerable though. There are two <em>other</em> reasons that kill this idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first reason why always using <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> wouldn’t work is that for native arrow functions (not the ones compiled by Babel), calling with <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> throws an error:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> <span class=\\"token function-variable function\\">Greeting</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token plain-text\\">Hello</span><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token tag\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">></span></span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>

<p>This behavior is intentional and follows from the design of arrow functions. One of the main perks of arrow functions is that they <em>don’t</em> have their own <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> value — instead, <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> is resolved from the closest regular function:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">class</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Friends</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">extends</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">React<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay, so <strong>arrow functions don’t have their own <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code>.</strong> But that means they would be entirely useless as constructors!</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> <span class=\\"token function-variable function\\">Person</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>name<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Therefore, <strong>JavaScript disallows calling an arrow function with <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>.</strong> If you do it, you probably made a mistake anyway, and it’s best to tell you early. This is similar to how JavaScript doesn’t let you call a class <em>without</em> <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>.</p>
<p>This is nice but it also foils our plan. React can’t just call <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> on everything because it would break arrow functions! We could try detecting arrow functions specifically by their lack of <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype</code>, and not <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> just them:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token operator\\">=></span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>prototype <span class=\\"token comment\\">// undefined</span>

<p>But this <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4599#issuecomment-136562930\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">wouldn’t work</a> for functions compiled with Babel. This might not be a big deal, but there is another reason that makes this approach a dead end.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another reason we can’t always use <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> is that it would preclude React from supporting components that return strings or other primitive types.</p>

<p>This, again, has to do with the quirks of the <a href=\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\"><code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> operator</a> design. As we saw earlier, <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> tells the JavaScript engine to create an object, make that object <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> inside the function, and later give us that object as a result of <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>.</p>
<p>However, JavaScript also allows a function called with <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> to <em>override</em> the return value of <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> by returning some other object. Presumably, this was considered useful for patterns like pooling where we want to reuse instances:</p>

<p>There is just no way to read a primitive return value (like a number or a string) from a function when calling it with <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>. So if React always used <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>, it would be unable to add support components that return strings!</p>
<p>That’s unacceptable so we need to compromise.</p>
<hr>
<p>What did we learn so far? React needs to call classes (including Babel output) <em>with</em> <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code> but it needs to call regular functions or arrow functions (including Babel output) <em>without</em> <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>. And there is no reliable way to distinguish them.</p>
<p><strong>If we can’t solve a general problem, can we solve a more specific one?</strong></p>
<p>When you define a component as a class, you’ll likely want to extend <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> for built-in methods like <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.setState()</code>. <strong>Rather than try to detect all classes, can we detect only <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> descendants?</strong></p>
<p>Spoiler: this is exactly what React does.</p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps, the idiomatic way to check if <code class=\\"language-text\\">Greeting</code> is a React component class is by testing if <code class=\\"language-text\\">Greeting.prototype instanceof React.Component</code>:</p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking. What just happened here?! To answer this, we need to understand JavaScript prototypes.</p>
<p>You might be familiar with the “prototype chain”. Every object in JavaScript might have a “prototype”. When we write <code class=\\"language-text\\">fred.sayHi()</code> but <code class=\\"language-text\\">fred</code> object has no <code class=\\"language-text\\">sayHi</code> property, we look for <code class=\\"language-text\\">sayHi</code> property on <code class=\\"language-text\\">fred</code>’s prototype. If we don’t find it there, we look at the next prototype in the chain — <code class=\\"language-text\\">fred</code>’s prototype’s prototype. And so on.</p>
<p><strong>Confusingly, the <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype</code> property of a class or a function <em>does not</em> point to the prototype of that value.</strong> I’m not kidding.</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">function</span> <span class=\\"token function\\">Person</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>

console<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">log</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>Person<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>prototype<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span> <span class=\\"token comment\\">// 🤪 Not Person's prototype</span>
console<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">log</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>Person<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>__proto__<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span> <span class=\\"token comment\\">// 😳 Person's prototype</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So the “prototype chain” is more like <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__.__proto__.__proto__</code> than <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype.prototype.prototype</code>. This took me years to get.</p>
<p>What’s the <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype</code> property on a function or a class, then? <strong>It’s the <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__</code> given to all objects <code class=\\"language-text\\">new</code>ed with that class or a function!</strong></p>

<p>And that <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__</code> chain is how JavaScript looks up properties:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">fred<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">sayHi</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// 1. Does fred have a sayHi property? No.</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// 2. Does fred.__proto__ have a sayHi property? Yes. Call it!</span>

fred<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span><span class=\\"token function\\">toString</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// 1. Does fred have a toString property? No.</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// 2. Does fred.__proto__ have a toString property? No.</span>
<span class=\\"token comment\\">// 3. Does fred.__proto__.__proto__ have a toString property? Yes. Call it!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In practice, you should almost never need to touch <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__</code> from the code directly unless you’re debugging something related to the prototype chain. If you want to make stuff available on <code class=\\"language-text\\">fred.__proto__</code>, you’re supposed to put it on <code class=\\"language-text\\">Person.prototype</code>. At least that’s how it was originally designed.</p>
<p>The <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__</code> property wasn’t even supposed to be exposed by browsers at first because the prototype chain was considered an internal concept. But some browsers added <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__</code> and eventually it was begrudgingly standardized (but deprecated in favor of <code class=\\"language-text\\">Object.getPrototypeOf()</code>).</p>
<p><strong>And yet I still find it very confusing that a property called <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype</code> does not give you a value’s prototype</strong> (for example, <code class=\\"language-text\\">fred.prototype</code> is undefined because <code class=\\"language-text\\">fred</code> is not a function). Personally, I think this is the biggest reason even experienced developers tend to misunderstand JavaScript prototypes.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a long post, eh? I’d say we’re 80% there. Hang on.</p>
<p>We know that when we say <code class=\\"language-text\\">obj.foo</code>, JavaScript actually looks for <code class=\\"language-text\\">foo</code> in <code class=\\"language-text\\">obj</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">obj.__proto__</code>, <code class=\\"language-text\\">obj.__proto__.__proto__</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>With classes, you’re not exposed directly to this mechanism, but <code class=\\"language-text\\">extends</code> also works on top of the good old prototype chain. That’s how our React class instance gets access to methods like <code class=\\"language-text\\">setState</code>:</p>

<p>And that check is how we could determine if something is a React component class or a regular function.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s not what React does though. 😳</p>
<p>One caveat to the <code class=\\"language-text\\">instanceof</code> solution is that it doesn’t work when there are multiple copies of React on the page, and the component we’re checking inherits from <em>another</em> React copy’s <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code>. Mixing multiple copies of React in a single project is bad for several reasons but historically we’ve tried to avoid issues when possible. (With Hooks, we <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">might need to</a> force deduplication though.)</p>
<p>One other possible heuristic could be to check for presence of a <code class=\\"language-text\\">render</code> method on the prototype. However, at the time it <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4599#issuecomment-129714112\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">wasn’t clear</a> how the component API would evolve. Every check has a cost so we wouldn’t want to add more than one. This would also not work if <code class=\\"language-text\\">render</code> was defined as an instance method, such as with the class property syntax.</p>
<p>So instead, React <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4663\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">added</a> a special flag to the base component. React checks for the presence of that flag, and that’s how it knows whether something is a React component class or not.</p>
<p>Originally the flag was on the base <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> class itself:</p>

<p>However, some class implementations we wanted to target <a href=\\"https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/1900\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">did not</a> copy static properties (or set the non-standard <code class=\\"language-text\\">__proto__</code>), so the flag was getting lost.</p>
<p>This is why React <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5021\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">moved</a> this flag to <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component.prototype</code>: </p>

<p><strong>And this is literally all there is to it.</strong></p>
<p>You might be wondering why it’s an object and not just a boolean. It doesn’t matter much in practice but early versions of Jest (before Jest was Good™️) had automocking turned on by default. The generated mocks omitted primitive properties, <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4663#issuecomment-136533373\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">breaking the check</a>. Thanks, Jest.</p>
<p>The <code class=\\"language-text\\">isReactComponent</code> check is <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/769b1f270e1251d9dbdce0fcbd9e92e502d059b8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiber.js#L297-L300\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">used in React</a> to this day.</p>
<p>If you don’t extend <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code>, React won’t find <code class=\\"language-text\\">isReactComponent</code> on the prototype, and won’t treat component as a class. Now you know why <a href=\\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/42680526/458193\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">the most upvoted answer</a> for <code class=\\"language-text\\">Cannot call a class as a function</code> error is to add <code class=\\"language-text\\">extends React.Component</code>. Finally, a <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11168\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">warning was added</a> that warns when <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype.render</code> exists but <code class=\\"language-text\\">prototype.isReactComponent</code> doesn’t.</p>
<hr>
<p>You might say this story is a bit of a bait-and-switch. <strong>The actual solution is really simple, but I went on a huge tangent to explain <em>why</em> React ended up with this solution, and what the alternatives were.</strong></p>
<p>In my experience, that’s often the case with library APIs. For an API to be simple to use, you often need to consider the language semantics (possibly, for several languages, including future directions), runtime performance, ergonomics with and without compile-time steps, the state of the ecosystem and packaging solutions, early warnings, and many other things. The end result might not always be the most elegant, but it must be practical.</p>
<p><strong>If the final API is successful, <em>its users</em> never have to think about this process.</strong> Instead they can focus on creating apps.</p>
<p>But if you’re also curious… it’s nice to know how it works.</p>

<p>Of course, the <a href=\\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">class fields proposal</a> lets us skip the ceremony:</p>

Defining <code class=\\"language-text\\">constructor</code> and calling <code class=\\"language-text\\">super(props)</code> was always intended to be a temporary solution until class fields provide an ergonomic alternative.</p>
<p>But let’s get back to this example using only ES2015 features:</p>

  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Why do we call <code class=\\"language-text\\">super</code>? Can we <em>not</em> call it? If we have to call it, what happens if we don’t pass <code class=\\"language-text\\">props</code>? Are there any other arguments?</strong> Let’s find out.</p>
<hr>
<p>In JavaScript, <code class=\\"language-text\\">super</code> refers to the parent class constructor. (In our example, it points to the <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> implementation.)</p>
<p>Importantly, you can’t use <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> in a constructor until <em>after</em> you’ve called the parent constructor. JavaScript won’t let you:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">class</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Checkbox</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">extends</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">React<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">super</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ✅ Now it’s okay though</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">this</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>state <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span> isOn<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">:</span> <span class=\\"token boolean\\">true</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s a good reason for why JavaScript enforces that parent constructor runs before you touch <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code>. Consider a class hierarchy:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">class</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Person</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Imagine using <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> before <code class=\\"language-text\\">super</code> call <em>was</em> allowed. A month later, we might change <code class=\\"language-text\\">greetColleagues</code> to include the person’s name in the message:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">greetColleagues</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But we forgot that <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.greetColleagues()</code> is called before the <code class=\\"language-text\\">super()</code> call had a chance to set up <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.name</code>. So <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.name</code> isn’t even defined yet! As you can see, code like this can be very difficult to think about.</p>
<p>To avoid such pitfalls, <strong>JavaScript enforces that if you want to use <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code> in a constructor, you <em>have to</em> call <code class=\\"language-text\\">super</code> first.</strong> Let the parent do its thing! And this limitation applies to React components defined as classes too:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token function\\">constructor</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">super</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ✅ Okay to use \`this\` now</span>
    <span class=\\"token keyword\\">this</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>state <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span> isOn<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">:</span> <span class=\\"token boolean\\">true</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This leaves us with another question: why pass <code class=\\"language-text\\">props</code>?</p>
<hr>
<p>You might think that passing <code class=\\"language-text\\">props</code> down to <code class=\\"language-text\\">super</code> is necessary so that the base <code class=\\"language-text\\">React.Component</code> constructor can initialize <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.props</code>:</p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token comment\\">// Inside React</span>

    <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And that’s not far from truth — indeed, that’s <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1d25aa5787d4e19704c049c3cfa985d3b5190e0d/packages/react/src/ReactBaseClasses.js#L22\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">what it does</a>.</p>
<p>But somehow, even if you call <code class=\\"language-text\\">super()</code> without the <code class=\\"language-text\\">props</code> argument, you’ll still be able to access <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.props</code> in the <code class=\\"language-text\\">render</code> and other methods. (If you don’t believe me, try it yourself!)</p>
<p>How does <em>that</em> work? It turns out that <strong>React also assigns <code class=\\"language-text\\">props</code> on the instance right after calling <em>your</em> constructor:</strong></p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\">  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// Inside React</span>
  <span class=\\"token keyword\\">const</span> instance <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">new</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">YourComponent</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">(</span>props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">)</span><span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span>
  instance<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>props <span class=\\"token operator\\">=</span> props<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So even if you forget to pass <code class=\\"language-text\\">props</code> to <code class=\\"language-text\\">super()</code>, React would still set them right afterwards. There is a reason for that.</p>
<p>When React added support for classes, it didn’t just add support for ES6 classes alone. The goal was to support as wide range of class abstractions as possible. It was <a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#other-languages\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\">not clear</a> how relatively successful would ClojureScript, CoffeeScript, ES6, Fable, Scala.js, TypeScript, or other solutions be for defining components. So React was intentionally unopinionated about whether calling <code class=\\"language-text\\">super()</code> is required — even though ES6 classes are.</p>
<p>So does this mean you can just write <code class=\\"language-text\\">super()</code> instead of <code class=\\"language-text\\">super(props)</code>?</p>
<p><strong>Probably not because it’s still confusing.</strong> Sure, React would later assign <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.props</code> <em>after</em> your constructor has run. But <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.props</code> would still be undefined <em>between</em> the <code class=\\"language-text\\">super</code> call and the end of your constructor:</p>

<p>It can be even more challenging to debug if this happens in some method that’s called <em>from</em> the constructor. <strong>And that’s why I recommend always passing down <code class=\\"language-text\\">super(props)</code>, even though it isn’t strictly necessary:</strong></p>
<div class=\\"gatsby-highlight\\" data-language=\\"jsx\\"><pre class=\\"language-jsx\\"><code class=\\"language-jsx\\"><span class=\\"token keyword\\">class</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">Button</span> <span class=\\"token keyword\\">extends</span> <span class=\\"token class-name\\">React<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">{</span>

  <span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span>
  <span class=\\"token comment\\">// ...</span>
<span class=\\"token punctuation\\">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This ensures <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.props</code> is set even before the constructor exits.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s one last bit that longtime React users might be curious about.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that when you use the Context API in classes (either with the legacy <code class=\\"language-text\\">contextTypes</code> or the modern <code class=\\"language-text\\">contextType</code> API added in React 16.6), <code class=\\"language-text\\">context</code> is passed as a second argument to the constructor.</p>
<p>So why don’t we write <code class=\\"language-text\\">super(props, context)</code> instead? We could, but context is used less often so this pitfall just doesn’t come up as much.</p>
<p><strong>With the class fields proposal this whole pitfall mostly disappears anyway.</strong> Without an explicit constructor, all arguments are passed down automatically. This is what allows an expression like <code class=\\"language-text\\">state = {}</code> to include references to <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.props</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">this.context</code> if necessary.</p>
<p>With Hooks, we don’t even have <code class=\\"language-text\\">super</code> or <code class=\\"language-text\\">this</code>. But that’s a topic for another day.</p>

In order to reduce disconnections, we have performed the following mitigation steps:• We have deployed additional hardware into the pool to distribute connections across more machines.• We have converted one of these regions to work across multiple availability zones, which was done before the beginning of Europe's workday on November 9th.• AWS has put a mitigation in place for the load balancers.We are deeply sorry for the disruption this has caused to your workdays.

In order to reduce disconnections, we have performed the following mitigation steps:• We have deployed additional hardware into the pool to distribute connections across more machines.• We have converted one of these regions to work across multiple availability zones, which was done before the beginning of Europe's workday on November 9th.• AWS has put a mitigation in place for the load balancers.We are deeply sorry for the disruption this has caused to your workdays.

Users who were already connected to the service were able to remain connected during this time.A configuration change at 10:15amPDT accessed incorrect settings and prevented service access for new connections. We reverted the configuration change at 10:59amPDT and new connections to the service were able to resume. We called the all clear at 11:23amPDT.We are currently hard at work to scope preventative measures to ensure this does not happen in the future.</p><p><small>11:23am PDT</small> - Connections have improved for all users, and folks should be able to connect again.

I’m talking about<a href=\\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\\">Amazon Simple Queue Service</a>, which nobody ever calls by its full name.</p><p>I’d been thinking I should write on the subject, then saw a Twitter thread from<a href=\\"http://rickbranson.com/\\">Rick Branson</a>(trust me, don’t follow that link) which begins<a href=\\"https://twitter.com/rbranson/status/1131989746643742721\\">Queues are bad, but software developers love them. You’d
think they would magically fix any overload or failure problem. But they don’t, and bring with them a bunch of their own
problems.</a>After that I couldn’t not write about queueing in general and SQS specifically.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/26/SQS-banner.png\\" alt=\\"SQS banner\\"/><h2 id=\\"p-1\\">SQS is nearly perfect</h2><p>The perfect Web Service I mean: There are no capacity reservations! You can make as many queues as you want to,
you can send as many messages as you want to, you can pull them off fast or slow depending how many readers you have. You can even
just ignore them; there are people who’ll dump a few million messages onto a queue and almost never retrieve them, except when
something goes terribly wrong and they need to recover their state.  Those messages will age out and vanish after a little while (14
days is currently the max); but before they go, they’re stored carefully and are very unlikely to go missing.</p><p>Also, you can’t see hosts so you don’t have to worry about picking, configuring, or patching them. Win!</p><p>There are a bunch of technologies we couldn’t run at all without SQS, ranging from<a href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/\\">Amazon.com</a>to modern Serverless stuff.</p><p>The API is the simplest thing imaginable: Send Messages, Receive Messages, Delete Messages.  I love things that do one thing simply,
quickly, and well.  I can’t give away details, but there are<em>lots</em>of digits in the number of messages/second SQS handles on
busy days. I can’t give away architectures, but the way the front-end and back-end work together to store messages quickly and
reliably is drop-dead cool.</p><p>Why not entirely perfect?  Well, SQS<a href=\\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_simple_q/\\">launched in 2006</a>. Most parts of the service have been re-implemented
at least once, but some moss has grown over the years. I sit next to the SQS team and know the big picture reasonably well, and I
think we can make SQS cheaper and simpler to operate.</p><p>When it launched it cost 10¢ per thousand messages; now it’s 40¢ per million
API calls. “Per-message” can be a bit tricky to work out because
sending, receiving, and deleting makes three calls per, but then SQS helps you batch and most high-volume apps do.
Anyhow, it’s absurdly cheaper than back then,
and I wonder whether, in a few years, that 40¢/million number will look as high as 10¢/thousand does today.</p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">The opposition</h2><p>So let’s go back to Mr Branson’s<a href=\\"https://twitter.com/rbranson/status/1131989746643742721\\">tweet-rant</a>.  He raises a bunch of objections to queues which
I’ll try to summarize:</p><ol><li><p>They can mask downstream failures</p></li><li><p>They don’t necessarily preserve ordering (SQS doesn’t).</p></li><li><p>When they<em>are</em>ordered, you probably need to shard to lots of different streams and keep track of the shard
readers.</p></li><li><p>They’re hard to capacity plan; it’s easy to fill up RAM and disks.</p></li><li><p>They don’t exert back-pressure against clients that are overrunning your system.</p></li></ol><p>Here’s his conclusion.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/26/anti-queue.png\\" alt=\\"Anti-queue closer from Rick Branson\\"/><p>While there<em>are</em>good queues, I agree with his sentiment.
If you can build a straightforward monolithic app and never think about all this
asynchronous crap, go for it! If your system is big enough that you need to refactor into microservices for sanity’s sake, but you
can get away with synchronous call chains, you definitely should.</p><p>But if you have software components that need to be hooked together, and sometimes the upstream runs faster than the
downstream can handle, or you need to scale components independently to manage load, or you need to make temporary outages
survivable by stashing traffic-in-transit, well… a queue becomes “absolutely necessary”.</p><p>The proportion of services I work on where queues are absolutely necessary rounds to 100%. And if you look at our customers, lots
of them manage to get away without queues (good for them!) but a really huge number totally depend on them. And I don’t think that’s
because the customers are stupid.</p><p>Mr Branson’s charges are accurate descriptions of queuing semantics; but what he sees as shortcomings, people who use queues see
as features. Yeah, they mask
errors and don’t exert back-pressure. So, suppose you have a retail website named after a river in Brazil, and you have
fulfillment centers that deliver the stuff the website sells. You<em>really</em>want to protect the website from
fulfillment-center errors and throttling. You want to<em>know</em>about those errors and throttling, and a well-designed messaging
system should<a href=\\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html\\">make that
easy</a>. Yeah, it can be a pain in the butt to capacity-plan a queue<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>ask anyone
who runs their own. That’s why your local public-cloud provider offers them as a managed service.  Yeah, some applications need ordering,
so there are queuing services that offer it. Yeah, ordering often implies sharding, and so your ordered-queue service should provide<a href=\\"https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client\\">a library to help with that</a>.</p><h2 id=\\"p-3\\">But wait, there’s more!</h2><p>More kinds of queues, I mean. AWS has<a href=\\"https://aws.amazon.com/messaging/\\">six different ones</a>. Actually, that page hasn’t been updated since we
launched<a href=\\"https://aws.amazon.com/msk/\\">Managed Streaming for Kafka</a>, so I guess we have seven now.</p><p>We actually did a Twitch<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdGHdjmr6oq4S3RzCJKVj_t\\">video lecture series</a>to help people sort out
which of these might hit their sweet spot.</p><p>With a whole bunch of heroic work, we might be able to cram together all these services into a smaller number of packages,
but I’d be astonished if that were a cost-effective piece of engineering.</p><p>So with respect, I have to disagree with Mr Branson. I’d go so far as to say that if you’re building a moderately complex piece
of software that needs to integrate heterogeneous microservices and deal with variable sometimes-high request loads, then if your
design doesn’t have a queuing component, quite possibly you’re Doing It Wrong.</p></div>",

We have fouled our species’ nest and are ignoring the smoke curling out of its
edges, and don’t know what’s awaiting when we fall out of the tree.  I’ve been sad a lot.</p><p>For days at a time, even.  I get up and find myself barking at my children for the smallest sins; just a shitty mood that I can’t
shake.  Introspecting, I see that I enjoy my job and get along with my family and am loved enough and have enough others
to love.  I like my car and my bike and my city and my garden.  And eventually I had to admit that it was the lousy state of the
world dragging me down.</p><p>What to do about it?  You can’t and anyway shouldn’t face away from the world.  We need to keep finding
the courage to face the truth and work on mending what’s broken. Because in my heart and my mind I actually really don’t believe
this is<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k\\">Ragnarök</a>; we are not (quoting Tolkien’s Galadriel) “fighting the long

That’s a no-brainer<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>would you prefer a just
or a merciful deity?</p><p>Why am I sharing this? Just a reminder that the world, uglified though it may be this year, contains wonders; the hope is
to lighten a rotten mood if only my own.  What we are trying to save is worth saving! See those paintings on the Goddess’
wall? They were said to represent her attendants and are worth a look.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/IMG_20190328_164057.png\\" alt=\\"On the wall of the temple of the Goddess of Mercy, Gubeikou\\"/><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">That said…</h2><p>In another part of the world, the country next to mine, sixty-five million people think Donald Trump is just fine and will
probably think so again in 2020.  In my own country, a morally-hollowed-out leadership is probably about to punch a bitumen pipeline
through the walls of sanity to the Pacific to increase our share of carbon loading even as the carbon numbers attain levels never
seen in our (or any) civilization. I could enumerate bad crazinesses in lots more timezones, but why? Anyone who troubles to find
out knows.</p><p>I find it hard to deal with the fact that, and I’m phrasing this as gently as I can manage, a substantial
proportion of the population seem ignorant, bigoted, and mean.  Perhaps the natural proportion of Deplorables has been made larger by
dysfunctional media. I’d like to believe that because media are fixable but endemic mean-spiritedness isn’t.</p><h2 id=\\"p-5\\">Horrorshow</h2><p>In Hong Kong, lining up for the Star Ferry across the harbor, among more tourists than locals since they put in the subway
tunnel, I came face-to-face with it. In a party of otherwise-unexceptionable Americans, there was the #MAGAhead with That Hat,
waddling, empty-eyed, enormously obese; folds of fat hanging out of the bottom of his golf shorts.
In the warm wet Chinese air I
couldn’t dig up a sane way to react or even a sane thing to say because, frankly, murder was uncoiling at the back of my brain.
Fortunately for that dude, I’m a grown-up.</p><h2 id=\\"p-3\\">More temple walls</h2><p>The ones without paintings are a canvas for nature to write on.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/XT300621.png\\" alt=\\"Shadows on a Chinese temple wall\\"/><p>Across the Pacific, nature writes in big letters.

enough, they’d have things to say that we’d benefit from hearing.
We need to do more getting out of the way.</p><h2 id=\\"p-4\\"><i>The Second Coming</i></h2><p>It’s really the biggest threat. I’m talking about these lines from<a href=\\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming\\">Yeats’ poem</a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br/>Are full of passionate intensity.</i></p></blockquote><p>It’s so easy to say “Screw it, what can I do?” and change the channel.
Let’s not. Let’s drink beers and sing songs and share pictures and sign petitions and get
arrested where it might matter; Let’s bathe shameless in our world’s good things but never say “Screw it”, because those good
things are worth, at the end of the day, dying for.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/IMG_20190517_081623.png\\" alt=\\"Wet poppy flowers\\"/><p>Our times are kind of particularly fucked up just now.

I really have no gripes, their gear seems to Just Work.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190415_110621.png\\" alt=\\"Charging the I-Pace\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190508_104257.png\\" alt=\\"Fast DC charger readout\\"/><p>The charger above is in Lynnwood, a suburb just north of Seattle. Amusingly, all the EVgo chargers have names, which actually
help you to figure out which is which when they’re in a cluster. That’s “Elijah” in Lynnwood.</p><p>The screenshot is from one of the chargers (“Ceres” and “Millie”) at the<a href=\\"https://www.rei.com/stores/seattle.html\\">REI flagship store</a>, which at a block off I-5 is super-handy, and also
a beautiful place to hang out and visit.  On this particular trip I got there a little
early and
charged for 28 minutes before my meetings and then another 25 after, picking up a total of 41kWh, and getting home with 30km of
battery to spare.  EVgo charged me $16.28.</p><p>The attentive reader will note that 117A at 415V is 48.55kW. I have yet to encounter one of the rumored-to-exist 100kW chargers,
but 53 minutes of charging for nearly six hours of driving at highway speeds across hilly terrain is bearable.  At this point
a snotty Tesla owner will point out that they have 100kW now and (for many of them) it’s free. Yeah, but your car is boring.</p><p>It’s worth noting that those fast chargers are kind of noisy; when they’re pumping 50kW into your vehicle there are
heavy-duty mechanical sounds coming out; presumably fans?  So you probably wouldn’t want one right next to your
patio or bedroom window.</p><p>Since we’re talking about charging, obviously almost all of that happens at home.  We hardly ever car-commute, with just minor
puttering around town and weekend excursions, end up charging once every week or ten days.  Looking at my power bill reveals I pay
somewhere around $2.50/day when I don’t charge, and six or seven bucks when I do. Yeah, the car pulls twice as much as the rest of
the house put together.  OK, our stove and water heater are natural gas; but still.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190509_170400.png\\" alt=\\"Charging the car at home\\"/><p>Above is the little carport we put in because I didn’t want either the charger or the Jag out in the weather all the time. If you
look close you can see the charger just behind the car.  This is just after the return from Seattle, so the car’s a little
cruddy.</p><p>The home “Level 2” charger is entirely silent, but then depending on the temperature the car sometimes turns on its fans to heat
or cool the batteries while charging; not for long, though.</p><p>We don’t have a garage door to open, but I wired the carport light up with a<a href=\\"https://amzn.to/308oxai\\">LiftMaster 823lm</a>light switch and now I can turn it on with the garage-door control on the
car’s rearview when I’m coming home after dark. I also had to get a<a href=\\"https://amzn.to/2vPxwj2\\">LiftMaster remote control</a>so I could turn it back off from inside the house.</p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">Good stuff</h2><p>You just can’t drive this puppy around without smiling.  It’s smooth, comfy, and amazingly athletic. Merging onto a big highway
is pure joy, and taking uphill curves hard will make you laugh out loud.
Even going with the flow in heavy traffic is a lot more relaxing than you’re probably used to.
When I get in any gas car now, it feels  klunky, noisy, and unresponsive.</p><p>You get compliments and smiles from border guards, both US and Canadian. Now<em>that</em>is a new experience.</p><p>Yesterday was a super-warm Spring day so now I’ve driven it in four seasons, more or less; the climate control and general
comfort is uniformly excellent, and I had my first experience of cooled seats, which feel amazingly great when you’ve been driving
for a couple of hours in the sun.</p><p>When I first got in the car I hated the audio, it sounded tinny and like it was coming out of the windshield. And yeah, the
default settings are lousy but they’re easy enough to fiddle; now the sound’s a warm bath of rich silky chocolate.</p><p>There are 3405km on the odometer (we’re pretty urban) and I haven’t had anything go wrong. Oh wait, let me amend that. Sometimes
(not very often) things will get a little weird<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>Android Auto won’t connect, or the radio-station list
won’t be there, or whatever. So, just like any other mobile computerized device, you pull over and you turn it off and back on
again, and generally then you’re OK. One time I had to reboot both the car<em>and</em>my phone.</p><h2 id=\\"p-3\\">Bad things</h2><p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: This car’s a joybringer on any road, urban or rural or freeway, but it is a<em>complete
fucking pig</em>to park.  It’s wide, and because of the cab-forward design you totally can’t see the teeny front hood of the car at all
from behind the wheel, so how in hell are you supposed to know whether you’re properly lined up at the curb or evenly between the
lines?  All these weeks in, I can now generally do a parallel park and end up about as straight as I’d expect from a
16-year-old trainee driver.  But I often have to take two or three passes at ordinary parking-lot slots.  And as for our carport,
it isn’t any too big, and the alley it’s off of isn’t any too wide.  I have on a single-digit number of occasions backed in straight
and centered on the first try, but never when any of the neighbors or family are watching.  I didn’t order the front camera option;
maybe that was a mistake?  Anyhow, I’m sure in another year or two I’ll be drifting into the carport.</p><p>What else can I complain about?  Yeah, the infotainment software is a little slow and klunky.  Six months into shipping this
thing JLR still doesn’t have the software OTA working.  I’m hoping that pretty soon it’ll be like my Fujifilm cameras and
periodically get updates that add features and make things better.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190417_182918.png\\" alt=\\"Magnolia I-Pace\\"/><h2 id=\\"p-4\\">Just a car</h2><p>At the end of the day, that’s all it is. It makes me happy to drive, happy to talk about, and I’m loading the atmosphere with a
whole lot less carbon than I used to.  But a new car isn’t a life-changer. Except for now I get a few more smiles every week.</p></div>",

sample from the “Garden of Longevity”.  It features ten thousand character forms which can be read as some variation on “Long Life”,
in a nice cloister around a serene courtyard.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190331_145406.png\\" alt=\\"The Garden of Longevity at Huangyaguan Great Wall Museum\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190331_145629.png\\" alt=\\"The Garden of Longevity at Huangyaguan Great Wall Museum\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190331_145845.png\\" alt=\\"The Garden of Longevity at Huangyaguan Great Wall Museum\\"/><p>Now, here’s a sidelight.

best preserved extant mausoleum complex in China”. They’re big all right, I suppose you could walk around them in a day but you’d be
exhausted. We put in several hours and only saw a few highlights.  Here’s the processional way leading in, flanked by lines of stone
animals. The animals come in pairs, for each species on is standing and another resting, to show that they guarded the tombs 24/7/365.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300548.png\\" alt=\\"Animal guard at the Eastern Qing Tombs\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300553.png\\" alt=\\"Animal guard at the Eastern Qing Tombs\\"/><p>The variety and beauty of carved stonework is remarkable, and it’s not just sitting there, it’s actively maintained.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300559.png\\" alt=\\"Maintaining the carvings at the Eastern Qing Tombs\\"/><p>We spent a lot of time at the tomb of the<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor\\">Qinlong Emperor</a>(1711-99), one of the most successful Chinese rulers

I asked why and our local guide (a required hire, and only adequate) said “Because he was

out with charming analog technology.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190401_105658.png\\" alt=\\"Dried-fruit vendor at the Eastern Qing tombs\\"/><p>The dried fruit was shockingly good.

Eventually
the people on the other side of it came south and became China’s rulers.  Theirs was the last dynasty, extending into the 20th
Century and eventually ended by the Chinese Revolution.</p><p>During its fading years, the most important character was the<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi\\">Dowager Empress Cixi</a>; that link is to her Wikipedia entry, which
has a pretty good photo portrait.  I think she was what today we would call pretty badass, and via a series of regencies was the
effective ruler of China from 1861 until her death in 1908.  She was from a family of the minor aristocracy , was brought into the
ruling family as a concubine, and found her way to the top.</p><p>Her tomb is generally great. Here are a couple of pictures of a little shrine that has a wonderful statue of a turtle/dragon
carrying a plinth with an inscription in Chinese, Manchurian, and Mongolian.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190401_113138.png\\" alt=\\"Statue at the tomb of Cixi\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190401_113214.png\\" alt=\\"Statue at the tomb of Cixi\\"/><p>And here’s her burial site, with some of the wood of her coffin showing.  It wasn’t a happy period for China, with the imperial
regime declining, partly under pressure from the British and other colonial land-grabbers.  I’d heard of the Dowager Empress, but
what I hadn’t realized that she was a fabulously accomplished artist; here are<a href=\\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_by_Empress_Dowager_Cixi\\">painting</a>and<a href=\\"https://www.google.com/search?biw=1758&bih=1049&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=TgTOXLzkDY7a_wT8j7zIDg&q=calligraphy+by++empress+cixi&oq=calligraphy+by++empress+cixi&gs_l=img.3...48105.49144..49392...0.0..0.65.611.11......1....1..gws-wiz-img.W7XT-msbbvM\\">calligraphy</a>.

on my screen; being face-to-face with these<em>big</em>graphics is really hard-hitting.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300588.png\\" alt=\\"The coffin of the Dowager Empress Cixi\\"/><p>It’s a great tourist site and I recommend it.

variety of reasons I got an<a href=\\"https://eero.com/\\">Eero</a>WiFi setup and so now I have to think about it.</p><p>What happened was, our ISP sent us a note saying “We upped your data from 150Mbps to 300.”  Our home infrastructure features Cat5
installed in the last century and an old Apple Time Capsule, none of us remember when we got it.  Also, we’d like<a href=\\"/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/\\">the new Jaguar</a>to get enough WiFi out in the carport to do downloads.</p><p>Wirecutter and a couple of other sites liked the Eero (I was a little surprised that the Google offering isn’t terribly
competitive). Because of the car, I bought a three-box configuration although our house could probably get by with two.</p><h2 id=\\"p-1\\">On Eero generally</h2><p>Haven’t had it long enough to say anything about reliability or trouble-shooting, but… what a fabulous onboarding experience.
The time it took to get all three boxes live on the air was dominated by the physical unboxing.  My employer is acquiring
Eero and I think we should immediately double the comp of their UX people then install them in glamorous corner
offices. AWS is getting better at UX, but this is next-level stuff.</p><p>Here’s the front page of their Android app.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/01/Screenshot_20190501-220840.png\\" alt=\\"Eero app\\"/><p>The only real flaw is their assumption that my cellphone ISP (the Rogers up at the top)
is the same company as our home ISP, which it isn’t. Amusingly, of the three devices listed, “HTC Corporation” is my Pixel 2,
“Aristophanes” is the 2014 MacBook Pro I’m writing this on, and “android-…” is my son’s beat-up old Motorola.  The network’s name
is “Humpback” because the one it’s replacing was “Orca”.</p><p>Down at the bottom, the performance numbers are where it gets interesting.  Our ISP says we’re getting 300M, but this is peak
evening time, someone’s streaming something on the TV and my son’s playing Apex Legends, and I bet similar things are happening at
houses all over our local cable loop.  It turns out the Eero runs network speed tests regularly, and keeps a log.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/01/Screenshot_20190501-220800.png\\" alt=\\"Eero network speed tests\\"/><p>You can see that at 5:30PM when everyone’s cooking dinner and commuting, we were actually getting the 300M the ISP
claims.<i>[Late update: It’s 11pm now and Eero says we’re getting 330 down.]</i></p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">How fast?</h2><p>Now, it’s not as if that 300M reaches the living room. If I go downstairs and stand near the base modem, I’ve seen as high as
280M on Speedtest.net, but I’ve never seen anything over 150 up where we live.  I haven’t cared enough yet to experiment with
placement.  And the old Mac Pro, wired through the old Time Capsule and another switch in the basement to the cable modem,
never gets near 100.  I suppose I should be unsatisfied with 150 down, 15-or-so up?</p><p>And of course these days, when I’m out and about and my phone says “LTE+” up in the status bar, which it does in most civilized
places, Speedtest claims to be
getting 90+ down and 30 or so up.  Which makes me wonder why WiFi is better.
Having said that, in Canada we have a rent-seeking telecoms cartel that rakes in<a href=\\"http://research.rewheel.fi/downloads/The_state_of_4G_pricing_DFMonitor_11th_release_1H2019_PUBLIC.pdf\\">among the highest
per-gig mobile data prices in the world</a>.</p><p>Good news: The car gets solid WiFi out back.</p><p>What does this all mean?  As an old guy, these bandwidths feel absurdly high.  The blockages and slowdowns we occasionally
encounter aren’t here, they’re Out There on the Net somewhere.</p><p>I do have a question, though:  What in freaking hell is 5G going to offer that’ll motivate us all to lash out for new
mobiles and services that’ll pay back the titanic investment it’ll take to offer it?  Beats the hellouta
me.</p></div>",

an illustrated narrative of what you might expect to do and see if you take this sort of tour.</p><p>[This is part of<a href=\\"/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/\\">The Surface of China</a>series.]</p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">Tour stuff</h2><p>Our party comprised 14 and our tour-guide Lijuan, of whom more
later.  We piled into a
little minibus with our backpacks in the first couple of rows and headed north out of Beijing.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190401_132121.png\\" alt=\\"Inside the tour bus\\"/><p>The party included four Canadian tech geeks and their two 12-year-old daughters and a wine merchant from Sydney; The rest were
from the south of England. They included a contractor/handyman, a rental-real-estate manager, four golfing friends, and young person
between jobs.  We were lucky; they were all good company.</p><p>The first thing you learn about the Wall is that it doesn’t run across the Chinese flatlands, but from mountaintop to
mountaintop.  So before you can start walking, you have to climb a
mountain.  Then you proceed up a steep slope to the mountain’s top,
then down the other side and up to the top of the next. Which is
to say, it’s tough walking.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300519.png\\" alt=\\"Uphill on the Great Wall\\"/><h2 id=\\"p-1\\">慕田峪</h2><p>In our letters,<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutianyu\\">Mutianyu</a>.  It’s not the main close-to-Beijing tourist destination that World
Leaders visit, but neither too distant nor too difficult.  It’s pretty civilized; you can take a lift to the top of the wall and a
weird sort of tube-slider down. You can buy a nice cold beer up on top and enjoy the view. We did all those things.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300282.png\\" alt=\\"View from the Mutianyu Great Wall\\"/><p>Yeah, those views, they’re definitely the thing you’ll remember if you visit the Wall, which while impressive is basically just a
wall. But the mountains and skies are different every minute.  On about the twentieth occasion that after climbing up some brutally steep
staircase I said “Oh… wow” a tourmate said “The views don’t get tired, do they?</p><h2 id=\\"p-1\\">箭扣</h2><p>In our letters,<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiankou\\">Jiankou</a>.  After we got off the wall we drove there, not that far, to a
guesthouse in the village of 西栅子 (Xizhazi), which is too small for a Wikipedia entry.  Here’s the lane up to the guesthouse.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300301.png\\" alt=\\"In Xizhazi village\\"/><p>It’s really small, and the guesthouse was, uh, rustically sincere. It’s a regular stop for climbing clubs, whose banners
festooned the central courtyard.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190327_175221.png\\" alt=\\"Guesthouse in Xizhazi\\"/><p>Just down the lane from the guesthouse was this thing, which I had to walk right up to to figure out.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190327_173833.png\\" alt=\\"Chicken coop in Xizhazi\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Chicken coop in Xizhazi.</p></div><p>That place may have been primitive, but they served us what I remember as the best food we got on the whole vacation, including
Hong Kong and Beijing.  We had lots of
beers and then it turned out Mr Fong, our driver, had a karaoke machine.  Festivities broke out.  Lauren sang<cite>Both Sides
Now</cite>. A few of the tourist ladies sang<cite>Dancing Queen</cite>and<cite>Valerie</cite>. The two twelve-year-olds sang<cite>Shut Up and Dance</cite>.  Mr Fong sang a romantic Chinese song by himself<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>a real crooner’s
voice<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>and then a duet with Lijuan the guide.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190327_202007.png\\" alt=\\"Karoke duet in Xizhazi\\"/><p>I want to stop and pay tribute to her. Lijuan Duan, is a special person, with endless expertise and energy. She
also owns the<a href=\\"https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g528741-d1898073-Reviews-Mekong_Cafe-Jinghong_Yunnan.html\\">Meking
Cafe</a>, a well-reviewed restaurant in Southern China, and is generally an excellent person.</p><p>Speaking of excellent people, so is Mr Fong.  Among other things, a
fantastically deft driver and a fine singer.
Well, as far as we could make out,
because he doesn’t speak much English.</p><p>It was a freezing cold night and the guesthouse was mostly unheated.  We were bundled up, enjoying the company, eating and
drinking, and the guesthouse owner joined us.  Then I saw a lovely tired lined face looking at us from out in the unsheltered
courtyard, looking amazed at the blonde people and the singing, not daring to come in. I’m betting she’s the one who made that
excellent food.  In the villages of China you see the occasional child but no young people.</p><p>Anyhow, we got up the next morning to start climbing, and found that it was snowing pretty hard.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190328_082229.png\\" alt=\\"Snow in Xizhazi\\"/><p>Fortunately, the guesthouse was not completely without heat.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190328_082533.png\\" alt=\\"Stove in Xizhazi\\"/><p>It was an hour’s pretty ambitious hike up to the Wall in the snow.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300313.png\\" alt=\\"Climbing up to the Jiankou great wall\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300312.png\\" alt=\\"Climbing up to the Jiankou great wall\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300316.png\\" alt=\\"Climbing up to the Jiankou great wall\\"/><p>See Mr Fong there with his umbrella?  What you can’t see is that he’s wearing shiny street shoes. In spite of which he was by a
mile our best climber on the scary parts of the climb.  And boy, were there ever a lot of them.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300334.png\\" alt=\\"The Jiankou Great Wall in snow\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300339.png\\" alt=\\"The Jiankou Great Wall in snow\\"/><p>I think that was our best day on the Wall.  I’ll never see anything like that again.</p><p>When we came down, we were exhausted.  What with all the snow and having taken a
few minor tumbles and general exhaustion, my hands were sufficiently beat-up that for two solid days I couldn’t fingerprint-unlock my
phone.</p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">古北口</h2><p>In our letters,<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubeikou\\">Gubeikou</a>.  We drove there after we came down off the snowy Wall, and the
guesthouse was a little more modern but not as welcoming nor was the food as good.  But it’s got a nice little riverfront park and some
excellent temples.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190328_165930.png\\" alt=\\"Cooking rice in Gubeikou\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300372.png\\" alt=\\"Drying cabbage in Gubeikou\\"/><h2 id=\\"p-3\\">The Long March</h2><p>The Gubeikou wall is OK, nothing special, neither the views nor the Wall itself equaled what we’d already seen. But that day was
brutal. We walked for six hours cross-country along the wall, or beside it in ruined sectors, to our next stop, and it was really
cold and windy nearly every step.
It was about 12km, which I’d have no trouble walking horizontally at a decent temperature, neither of which
applied here.  Here’s our tour-group, and a section of the Wall that we walked every inch of.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190329_102848.png\\" alt=\\"Tour group on Gubeikou Great Wall\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190329_103605.png\\" alt=\\"Gubeikou Great Wall\\"/><p>Finally, we limped down the mountain, and I have rarely been as happy to see a human face as Mr Fong’s, waving “come<em>this</em>way!” at the bottom of the path.</p><h2 id=\\"p-4\\">金山岭</h2><p>In our letters, Jinshanling.  Probably the nicest and best-maintained part of the Wall.  When we stumbled into our guesthouse
there, it was under construction outside, but squeaky-clean inside, and in our room the heater had been turned on and set to
30°C, unreasonably warm unless you’ve just spent six hours trudging over Chinese mountaintops in
a freezing wind.  After 45 minutes or so, I was somewhat thawed.</p><p>Here’s the dining room, where we got in a few games of Mah Jongg.  You don’t see a ceiling like that every day.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190329_174820.png\\" alt=\\"Guesthouse in Jinshanling\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190330_221613.png\\" alt=\\"Guesthouse in Jinshanling\\"/><p>If you wanted to make a one-day Wall visit and maybe didn’t want to take on the near-verticals of Jiankou, I’d say Jinshanling is
the place to go.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190330_103717.png\\" alt=\\"Jinshanling Great Wall\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190330_113448.png\\" alt=\\"Jinshanling Great Wall\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300452.png\\" alt=\\"Jinshanling Great Wall\\"/><p>There was one more day on the wall, at 黄崖关 (Huangyaguan) in Tianjin province, but meh, nothing to write home about after what
we’d already seen.</p><h2 id=\\"p-5\\">Take-aways</h2><p>It’s fantastic. Belongs on most bucket lists.  Take a guide.</p><p>Lijuan says the best time to go is in Autumn, and I think that’s probably right. I’ll never forget those views.</p></div>",

special. But it had street life, notably including dancing. There were three separate dance scenes within a couple of blocks.  We’re
talking about a ghetto-blaster on a stand on the plaza in front of a mall or apartment building, maybe a dance leader, and then a
gaggle of couples with wildly varying skill, dancing apparently for pure pleasure.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/VID_20190401_211640-2.png\\" alt=\\"Dance out-take\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>An out-take from<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNguRAD6w-Q\\">seventeen seconds of video</a>on YouTube.</p></div><p>Another scene elsewhere on the same plaza was a little more downtempo, and then another on a darker plaza very
old-school<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>strictly waltzes<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>and more romantic.</p><h2 id=\\"p-5\\">Dogs</h2><p>Beijing’s pups are excellent. They’re mostly medium-sized, neither hulking nor tiny, a lot of them somehow look sort of
Chinese, and by and large are cheery, quiet, and well-behaved.  A lot of them are off-leash, trotting along keeping pace with
their people, staying out of trouble.  Mostly they look neither overstressed nor underfed, including the ones trotting here and
there<i>sans</i>human, looking like they know where they’re going.  I gather they are<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat\\">at some risk</a>of being eaten; but a tip of the hat to the non-dog-eating people
who seem to be taking good care of theirs.</p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">Silent driving!</h2><p>In the accompanying Dislike piece I bitched about Beijing’s overly-wide over-occupied streets. It turns out that the big ones come with
little mini-streets on each side for use by anything that’s not a car, which includes bikes, motorcycles, and a whole lot of
power-trikes, where the space behind the driver can be a seat for a couple of passengers, or a rack for power tools, or really
anything in between.  What you can’t help noticing is that (in<em>my</em>Beijing hood, anyhow) more than half of these non-cars
are now electric.  Doesn’t mean that you won’t get creamed and rushed to emergency if you don’t focus (unless of course
you powerfully radiate no-fucks-to-give-here), but these auxiliary streets are kind of peaceful, I wish Vancouver had more like this.</p><p>Here are a couple of snaps, illustrating the minor-street-off-major-street thing.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300702.png\\" alt=\\"Streetside Beijing traffic\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300705.png\\" alt=\\"Streetside Beijing traffic\\"/><p>Check out the brown polka-dotted thing on the front of the red-coated dude’s bike. I’d never seen one before but they’re
everywhere in Beijing. It gets cold there in winter and I guess one of these will keep you warm without having to suit up in a dorky
cycling outfit.</p><p>Speaking of electric vehicles, China knows it’s got a pollution problem and is working on it.  We were driving along a nice
modern highway and stopped in at a service center, totally like the kind we have here at home along the highway, and it had a brand-new
electric-vehicle charging station.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/charging-station.png\\" alt=\\"EV charging station in China\\"/><p>That car is a<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto\\">BYD</a>, a domestic Chinese automaker that pumps out lots of electrics. If the
picture looks
a little weird that’s because I fat-fingered the Pixel into “portrait” mode. The driver got a little tense and
nervous when the large foreigner strolled over and started taking his picture.  Sorry about that, dude; if I spoke a word of Chinese
I’d have chatted you up, as a fellow EV owner, wanting to know about the finer points of charging China.</p><h2 id=\\"p-3\\">The Temple of Heaven</h2><p>Our last day in Beijing was the best, someone recommended the<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Heaven\\">Temple of Heaven</a>, and is it ever great.  Not the temples, the place and
the people. It’s green and away from traffic and has plenty of room for everyone<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>none of which is
otherwise in plentiful in Beijing.  Not that it was empty, it was buzzing, mostly with old people, most of them wholesomely
active.</p><p>Here are a bunch of dudes playing<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianzi\\">毽子 (Jianzi)</a>, hackey-sack with a big shuttlecock, which dates back 2400 years or
so in China.  These guys were not young but damn, they were deft, deploying lots of slick behind-the back and knee-to-foot and
heel-kick moves, and that shuttlecock wasn’t hitting the ground very often at all.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300606.png\\" alt=\\"Jianzi players in the Temple of Heaven\\"/><p>Then there was this big area full of exercise equipment, mostly occupied, mostly by older folk, here and there a child in
evidence.  I tried a thing I can only describe as a knee-swinging striding machine, and it made my legs feel great! Wish there was
one in our neighborhood park.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300611.png\\" alt=\\"Exercising in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing\\"/><p>Another thing that happens in the park is music; people go out and practice. Here’s one area that attracts saxophonists; this picture
only catches a couple, but there were more.  They’re within earshot of each other but that doesn’t seem to bother them.  I strolled
down the middle and among all the practice phrasing it was like a performance of abstract modern music; not unpleasant at
all.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300609.png\\" alt=\\"Saxophonists practice in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing\\"/><p>Then there was this guy with a lap guitar and beatbox, he had loads of soul. Seriously,<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eccvUADunNo\\">check the video</a>.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/VID_20190402_093754-1.png\\" alt=\\"Swinging guitar in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing\\"/><p>At another point there was a dude singing opera with accordion accompaniment, and while he neither looked nor sounded
exceptional, he was competent and it was a fine thing to be sitting in the green listening to the arias.  Did I mention it was green
and spacious?</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300620.png\\" alt=\\"Green space in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing\\"/><p>Occasionally there would be a person alone among the trees practicing Tai Chi.</p><p>And oh, right, temples too.  These are from the

the side, some purely exquisite spaces. Here are two.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300205.png\\" alt=\\"In the Forbidden City, Beijing\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/IMG_20190326_124032.png\\" alt=\\"In the Forbidden City, Beijing\\"/><p>Back to the people; here’s a random nice outfit.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/IMG_20190402_091125.png\\" alt=\\"Lady in pink shiny top\\"/><p>After the temple, we went to<a href=\\"http://jingabrewing.com/\\">京A Brewing</a>and after two weeks of Chinese food I heartily enjoyed a cheeseburger and a very
decent IPA.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/IMG_20190402_135635.png\\" alt=\\"Jing-A Brewing, Beijing\\"/><p>Then we strolled through<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangfujing\\">Wangfujing</a>, a high-toned expensive shopping district, with a side-bazaar
in which you can buy any imaginable food that can be presented on a stick as well as some that never should be such as scorpions,
still wiggling.  Wangfujing is fun if a little ostentatious, I recommend it.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300691.png\\" alt=\\"Ice cream in Wangfujing, Beijing\\"/><p>On our last morning, before heading to the airport we walked randomly around the residential parts of Jiaomen; it was a quiet
sunny morning, the pollution not too bad.  There were oldsters on exercise machines in parks and playing/kibitzing chess games and
just hanging out.  A guy working on an electrical box beamed when we gave him a<i>Nihao</i>.  The buildings are low-rises, older. I

The streets are big and wide and full of aggression; traffic is a competitive sport which you win by convincing others that you
have fewer fucks to give. Lane invasion is basic, and a key technique is that neither a lane’s invader nor its defender must ever
look at nor otherwise acknowledge each other until someone inevitably brakes and gives way.</p><p>All the roads are full, all the time.  “The airport’s half an hour away, better allow ninety minutes to be sure” they said, and
it took us sixty; things got faster after we got past these guys.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/IMG_20190403_115526.png\\" alt=\\"Beijing highway problem\\"/><p>The roads are full and the sidewalks and subways are too, full of people.  One place they’re especially full is around
Tienanmen square.  You arrive at the subway and have to parade through endless packed passages and staircases, emerge across
the street, then through another tunnel to come up into its vastness.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/IMG_20190326_091103.png\\" alt=\\"Heading for Tienanmen\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Heading for Tienanmen.</p></div><p>And I just can’t talk about that place without getting into politics.  Let’s be clear: In 2019, the<a href=\\"http://cpc.people.com.cn\\">Communist Party of China</a>is the world’s leading oppressor of human beings.
I’m not going to enumerate all the sins here, but it’s worth mentioning the pervasive censorship, the savage oppression of ethnic
minorities, and the corruption that flows Lamborghinis steadily onto the streets of Vancouver.  It’s not just the air that stinks.</p><p>The Great Wall
was built at extreme cost in blood and treasure to protect the Chinese people from the barbarians outside. To me it looks like the
barbarians won, and are now headquartered in the Great Hall of the People.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/XT300174.png\\" alt=\\"Great Hall of the People\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Great Hall of the People.</p></div><p>Which is of course overlooks Tienanmen. To be honest the whole place made me shudder. The security apparatus is
ubiquitous, in-yo-face every moment.  Quite likely, one of these years the people of China will run out of patience and terminate
the barbarian claque. But you can be damn sure that the trouble isn’t gonna start in Tienanmen, that puppy is locked down so tight it
squeaks.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/IMG_20190326_094707.png\\" alt=\\"Tienanmen Square security apparatus\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Some of the security apparatus.</p></div><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/IMG_20190326_100435.png\\" alt=\\"Guards in Tienanmen Square\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/XT300187.png\\" alt=\\"Guards in Tienanmen Square\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Dress-up with a message.</p></div><p>Everywhere in Tienanmen there is shouting<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>the tour-group wranglers I mean, chivvying

Unless you’re running with a foreign SIM.
But if you have one then you can’t connect to the hotel or any other public WiFi.</p><p>I look at China’s generations and
they look more different from each other than ours do.  The oldest ones saw endless war, the middle-aged ones went through the
Cultural Revolution, and there are all these sharp-dressed young folk who’ve only ever known a modern-ish
fast-growing China where all your daily needs are probably pretty well satisfied, as long they don’t include knowing what’s
happening outside China, or the truth about what’s happening inside. Old people aren’t just short, they’re beat-down; but
many young Chinese men are taller than me.</p><p>Behind Tienanmen is The Forbidden City.  They had some lovely things and quiet courtyards in the Treasure House, but frankly, it
mostly wasn’t that beautiful and there was nothing to warm your heart.  It is huge beyond hugeness, and entirely designed to assert
the power of the State over its cowed citizens.  The State in those days was personalized, with a living breathing Emperor.  Some of those
were barbarians too, by birth or by habit.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/XT300202.png\\" alt=\\"Inside the Forbidden City\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Some of the eighty thousand or so a day tourists<br/>who stream through the Forbidden City.</p></div><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">Also breakfast</h2><p>Along with the car-centrism and the barbaric dictatorship, there are the breakfasts.

breakfast and it cast a pall over every day I had to start with one.

Not too long ago, I bought an
X-T2, and then a few days later dropped it four feet onto pavement. Sob. Then Fuji shipped the X-T3 and
I’d decided to pick one up for the Chinese excursion, but before I did they followed up with this thing.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300207.png\\" alt=\\"Lunch break in the Forbidden City\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Lunch break in Beijing’s Forbidden City.<br/>35mm, 1/1000,<i>f</i>/5.6, ISO 160.</p></div><p>Let’s see… same sensor and processor, smaller and lighter (383g as opposed to 539), not waterproof (but most of my lenses aren’t
either). Slightly less video mojo (I use my phone for that).  $600 cheaper.  Of these criteria, the size and weight were the biggies
for me; it was compactness that moved me from SLR to the mirrorless space six years ago, and remember, I was just heading out on a
walking-oriented trip that was listed as “challenging”.  This was not a difficult choice.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300213.png\\" alt=\\"A treasure from the Forbidden City\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Forbidden City treasure #1. 35mm, 1/340,<i>f</i>/1.4, ISO 160.</p></div><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300218.png\\" alt=\\"A treasure from the Forbidden City\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Forbidden City treasure #2. 35mm, 1/50,<i>f</i>/1.4, ISO 400.<br/>Bit of a Miyazaki flavor here.</p></div><p>Problem was, the camera hit the shelves on March 20th, the same day I was getting on a trans-Pacific flight at noon.
No problemo!  Because<a href=\\"https://www.wingshingphoto.com/\\">萬成/永成攝影器材</a>(Wing Shing photo) was right around the corner from my Hong Kong
hotel, so when I arrived (on the 21st) I went there for a walk after supper.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300221.png\\" alt=\\"The exterior wall of the Forbidden City\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>By the Forbidden City’s exit. 35mm, 1/500,<i>f</i>/4.5, ISO 160.</p></div><p>The X-T30 was in stock, in all the color trims.  I asked “how much?” and they told me, I said “let me check the price back
home” and used my phone to pull up the Canadian price.  The store was a little quiet and the other Wing Shing dudes gathered around,
amused.  Turns out Fuji has steely price discipline; the prices were within $10. The dudes were impressed.
They threw in a 64G card and HK doesn’t have
sales tax.  And when I got back home the Canadian customs lady decided not to charge me the sales tax, which she could have.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300233.png\\" alt=\\"Canal outside the forbidden city\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Forbidden city canal corner. 35mm, 1/140,<i>f</i>/16, ISO 160.<br/>Maybe my favorite China picture.</p></div><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">Findings</h2><p>None of these should surprise anybody who keeps an eye on Fuji.</p><p><i>Item:</i>Oh, it’s so light!

Samyang/X-T30 combo yet; that’s OK.</p></div><p><i>Item:</i>Some combination of the touch-screen and overly thorough state retention meant that a high proportion of the times I picked
up the camera, the focus area was off uselessly in some corner or another.  I changed multiple settings: Disabled
the touch screen, required punch-to-activate on the joystick, maybe more; and eventually this stopped happening.  Now I can go back
and judiciously relax the settings.</p><p><i>ProTip:</i>When this does happen, press the joystick down (twice maybe) and that recenters
the focus.  This is terribly important to me because I’m a reaction shooter and when I bring the camera up to my eye and aim at what
I’m reacting to, I don’t want to waste time moving the focus around.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300417.png\\" alt=\\"View near Gubeikou Great Wall\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Gubeikou Great Wall view. 55-200mm@57.8, 1/600,<i>f</i>/5.6, ISO

(single-shot, video, panorama, bracketing, motor drive, yadda yadda) that used to be squashed underneath it. For me this is a
win/win, since I hand-selected an ISO exactly once in the six years I’ve been in Fuji-land, but I regularly want to switch modes.
Way back in 2013, I<a href=\\"/ongoing/When/201x/2013/10/18/Fufifilm-X-E1#p-2\\">pronounced the Fuji controls “perfect”</a>and I pretty well stand by that
finding. Everything I ever want to change is available on a handy physical dial, and nothing else is there getting in the way.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300444.png\\" alt=\\"Tree blossoms near Gubeikou Great Wall\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Blossoms near Jinshanling.  35mm, 1/680,<i>f</i>/4.5, ISO 160.</p></div><p><i>Item:</i>The EVF is not as big as I’m used to and I miss that, but I can’t honestly claim that it’s cost me pictures.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300538.png\\" alt=\\"In the Huangyaguan Great Wall Museum\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>In the Huangyaguan Great Wall Museum.<br/>35mm, 1/1250,<i>f</i>/6.4, ISO

I’m a finder, 100%.  Which means I need the
camera to be always with me, and shoot fast, and have<em>really</em>good ergonomics.  If you’re like me, the X-T30 might just be
the best camera in the world.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300649.png\\" alt=\\"Lauren at 京A Brewing\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Lauren at<a href=\\"http://jingabrewing.com/\\">京A Brewing</a>, Beijing. 18-55mm@18, 1/25,<i>f</i>/2.8, ISO

Fujifilm.  That’s a little misleading because there are a few X-T30 motor-drive action sequences of kids cartwheeling and swinging on
ropes and so on.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300683.png\\" alt=\\"Ducklings on a Stick near Wangfujing\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Ducklings on a stick near Wangfujing. 35mm, 1/120,<i>f</i>/1.8, ISO

general-purpose device while every atom of the X-T30 is optimized for making shooting easy and productive.  But the Pixel is so
fabulously effective at wide-angles and close-up shots and people, I don’t think of it as being a “better” or “worse” camera than
the Fuji, just different.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300708.png\\" alt=\\"Beijing small vehicles\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Beijing micromobility. 35mm, 1/50,<i>f</i>/8, ISO 160.<br/>There’s a big cool photo-project in this.</p></div><h2 id=\\"p-5\\">Lensing</h2><p>I took four: 18-55mm F2.8-4 (135 photos), 35mm F1.4 (86), 55-200mm F3.5-4.8 (49), Samyang 135mm F2 (12).  The 18-55mm has
lightning autofocus and on the X-T30 is just insanely fast and flexible, ideal when you have no idea what kind of thing you’re going to
shoot but you’re going to need to shoot quick.  The 35mm is my all-time favorite lens, its autofocus is klunky but it makes
everything you point it at look better. The 55-200mm doesn’t have much personality but if you’re going to be climbing mountains and
so on, you sometimes really need all those millimeters. The Samyang is maddeningly difficult and super-opinionated, not to mention
cruelly bulky and heavy,  but when you find the right subject, it’s a miracle-worker.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300723.png\\" alt=\\"Blossom in Jiaomen, Beijing\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Blossom in Jiaomen, Beijing. Seven hundred twenty-third.<br/>35mm, 1/1600,<i>f</i>/4, ISO 160.</p></div><p>I consciously adopted a discipline of going out with one flexible zoom and one difficult/opinionated prime: Usually the 35mm and
18/55 in town, then in the country, either 18-55 and Samyang, or the 35 and 55-200. I refuse to carry a big camera bag so two lenses
is about all I can manage out on the trail.   I liked this formula and think I’ll stick with it for a while.</p><h2 id=\\"p-6\\">Wrapping up</h2><p>Assuming I avoid dropping this thing, it should last me a long time.  I still have the X-T1; I give it to my
twelve-year-old daughter with the 18-55mm screwed on and everything set to auto, and she goes nuts, taking hundreds of photos of
which a few turn out great.</p><p>I don’t think you can get more camera for the money. I don’t think I can get a better camera for my style for any money.</p></div>",

new and huge.</p><p>[This is part of<a href=\\"/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/\\">The Surface of China</a>series.]</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/IMG_20190325_072609.png\\" alt=\\"Hong Kong West Kowloon station\\"/><p>It’s faster than an airport but there are really a lot of stages to get through: HK exit, HK customs, security, PRC health, PRC
customs, PRC immigration.  They were all reasonably efficient and pleasant but damn it’s a lot of walking. Obvious foreigners are
waved over to the “special services” PRC immigration where they speak English.  As in most dictatorships, there’s plenty of assiduous
filling-in of forms and triple-checking numbers and photos and signatures.</p><p>The train interior is, well, meh.  Nothing terribly wrong with it but not as slick as either the Japanese<i>shinkansen</i>or
a Euro-TGV/ICE.  There are classes: Business, First, Second. We took the mid-range First; the price was reasonable and the seats
were OK, with a bit of lean-back and plenty of electricity.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/XT300140.png\\" alt=\\"The interior of train G80 from Hong Kong to Beijing\\"/><p>The food was awful, but it’s been a long time since I got good food on a train anywhere.  I had to respect the staff, who
pushed the tea-carts and refreshments back and forth for nine consecutive hours without exhibiting fatigue.  None
seemed to have a word of English.</p><p>If you want to travel, direct online ticket sales are difficult-at-best for foreigners.  We followed leads around the Internet
and eventually bought the tickets via<a href=\\"https://www.chinahighlights.com/\\">China Highlights</a>, who got them from the station and delivered them to our Hong Kong
hotel before we got there.</p><p>Traveling at 300km is sort of dreamy.  I don’t have a good way to host video myself, so here are<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzmWqyCDgyA\\">27 seconds on YouTube</a>.</p><p>During the first couple of hours, the sky was that South Chinese dappled-grey while the terrain was green, folded, and wet.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/XT300149.png\\" alt=\\"South China from the train\\"/><p>Two thousand kilometers, but rarely out of sight of human habitation, and never away from infrastructure: Power
lines, dikes, culverts, you name it.</p><p>As we worked our way north the land became flatter and dirtier and more industrial and more intensely under construction.  This
picture is unusual in that there are no visible cranes.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/IMG_20190325_131934.png\\" alt=\\"Industrial scene in central China\\"/><p>Any extended exposure to China<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>this theme will recur<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>leaves most
Westerners overwhelmed by its most significant fact: its huge population.  On this trip the train stopped at
Shenzhen (pop 12.9M), Guanghzhou (14.9M), Changsha (a mere 7.4M), Wuhan (10.6M), Zhengzhou (10.1M), and Shijiazhuang
(10.8M). Total: 66.7M human souls.  You can claim you already knew about those places but I probably wouldn’t believe you.</p><p>It’s not subtle: as you coast from city to city, often the horizon hides behind a forest of high-rises.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/IMG_20190325_144229.png\\" alt=\\"Somewhere in central China\\"/><p>In the picture above, it all looks kind of prosperous: The pretty-modern buildings in the background, the gas stations and
boulevards in front.  It’s not all like that; in the hilly green southern section you see really poor-ass rural
scenes, but the surface prosperity monotonically increases as you move further north and toward Beijing.</p><p>Wherever you go in the world, you can usually tell a lot about a person by their address, and even more by visiting that address
and looking at their residence.  I’m sure you can in China too, only I can’t because I don’t know anything, and it was frustrating.
There were low primitive places among the fields, little better than shacks, then two-story countryside clusters that
offered a little room but no apparent luxury, then the ubiquitous apartment towers, low and high, shiny and faded.  What does
it all mean? Ask elsewhere.</p><p>I noticed that out away from the cities there was a lot of empty space on the roads; thought how much fun it might be to
do a road trip in a fast car.</p><p>Obviously, China’s decades-long  avalanche of investment and development hasn’t had flawless execution. There are many towers
built but not finished, their windows unoccupied concrete rectangles, some finished partway up but no apparent work in progress.
Bridges and causeways and berms and embankments too: infrastructural work paused and left to stand like huge pieces of brutalist
sculpture.</p><p>But of course lots of construction is in active progress; this near Beijing.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/XT300164.png\\" alt=\\"Residential construction near Beijing\\"/><p>Beijing West station, when you get there, is insanely crowded but reasonably efficient; the only thing you have to be careful of
is the taxi touts who I’m told will rip you off.  They’re somewhat handicapped in that a native Chinese speaker who hasn’t studied
English really has trouble with our letter “x”, but they have hustle.
Follow the signs to the nice modern taxi-stand and you won’t have to wait long. It’s a good idea to visit your
hotel’s website before you go and find the place where they provide a map-with-directions you can print out and show the
driver.</p><p>Then you’re into Beijing traffic, and may God have mercy on your soul.</p></div>",

monasteries, the new airport, Disneyland, and some damn nice hiking trails; I spent a pleasurable few hours on those a couple of
decades ago. Anyhow, when we were there in March the marine weather was awful, so no pix from the boat. But Mui Wo is…
different. Green, uncrowded (by HK standards) and weirdly full of foreigners.  I can see wanting to live here if I were working
there.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300056.png\\" alt=\\"Small boats at Mui Wo\\"/><p>Then you take a taxi or a bus across the island to Ngong Ping where the Buddha is.  If there are three or four of you the cost is
probably a wash, but the taxis can be hard to get. It’s a charming ride, a half-hour or so; try to get a window seat on the left.
The village isn’t worth your time really, but the religious enclosure, including Buddha and the Po Lin monastery, is. It was a foggy
day.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300059.png\\" alt=\\"The Tian Tan Buddha in the fog\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300071.png\\" alt=\\"The stairs up to the Tian Tan Buddha\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>There are a lot of steps up to the Buddha;<br/>this was on a weekend day, but out of season.</p></div><p>There’s a nice little art exhibit and gift shop inside the base of the Buddha.

In a big room up at the back of the temple, a
religious service was in progress.  The audience was in three groups, each with priests at the front. There was rough but beautiful
priest-led crowd-supported chanting, with the sections alternately standing and kneeling.  I stood and watched for several minutes
and the chanting never stopped.</p><p>It bothers me that, while I’ve studied some Buddhist basics, I really haven’t the faintest idea what these people learned as kids
from the parents or as young people from the clergy; nor what the ceremony meant; nor what a modern Hong Kong Buddhist is likely to
actually believe.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300098.png\\" alt=\\"Burning incense at Po Li monastery\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Major incense!</p></div><p>In normal times there’s a cable car that’ll take you straight to Ngong Ping from the big MTR (public transit) station by the
airport, but it wasn’t working that day so we hopped a taxi and got into some real adventure because Lantau traffic was light and
the driver ninja’d each and every of the many turns on the way to the train, wheels screeching.  Halfway, he turned to us, eyes crinkling:

notes.  So, as photog and blogger, I ought to be eager to share. There’s a problem: It’s all surface stuff.  Did I get lots of
interesting visuals? Did I eat lots of interesting food?  Did I get off the beaten track?  Yes to all of those.</p><p>But, how many
Chinese people did I get into serious conversations with? Three. Did those conversations go near any of the difficult subjects of
history or government or truth? Nope.  Do I understand what life feels like for any of the people I saw and
occasionally photographed?  No.</p><p>So I’ll share pictures because they’re pretty and stories that I think interesting or entertaining or
maybe useful to other Westerners planning a visit.  But, don’t kid yourself that you’re going to learn anything deep or important
about China beyond what it looks like.  This wasn’t research, it was tourism.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/06/IMG_20190328_163618.png\\" alt=\\"View in Gubeikou\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Looking over the roofs of the temples in<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubeikou\\">Gubeikou</a>.</p></div><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">Notes on getting around</h2><ul><li><p>Vancouver to HK is 12½ hours; that’s rough.</p></li><li><p>Hong Kong is easy to get around in; get an Octopus card at the first opportunity and public transit will take you more or
less anywhere at a reasonable price.  Taxis are OK but (like everywhere in the world) traffic is terrible.</p></li><li><p>The long fast train from HK to Beijing was a treat. The train food is trash but the seats are comfy and you’ll see a whole
lot of China really fast.  The train stations at either end are reasonably efficient and manageable.</p></li><li><p>The<a href=\\"https://www.gadventures.com/\\">G Adventures</a>tour was excellent.  I’m not normally a guided-tour kind of person, and have
enough travel experience and language smatterings to get by most places, not including mainland China.  Our guide and driver
were excellent, the route well-chosen, and the price very reasonable.</p></li><li><p>Beijing is tough to get around in.  The subway system is easy to figure out but the ticket-selling machines are klunky and
failure-prone, and the place is so freaking huge that you’re often a long walk from the nearest station. Taxi fares are
reasonable, but near any major tourist attraction the drivers will refuse to go on-meter and demand exorbitant prices.</p></li><li><p>The traffic in Beijing is terrible too.  Imagine that.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\\"p-4\\">Sharing plans</h2><p>I have way too many pictures to blog or Tweet or whatever; come over for dinner if you’re in town and I’ll do a slide show.  I’ll
write a few blog fragments and share some of the prettier pix, and after all a close look at the surface of China is better than no
look at all.</p></div>",

cover grabbed my attention sufficiently that I had to go look at it, and then took it home.  There’s a story in here about signs and
signals and that sort of stuff.</p><p>It’s a whodunnit basically, although the author chats away in his own voice, the protagonist keeps wondering if he’s in a novel,
the story shamelessly mixes real things that happened to real people with things that definitely didn’t happen and others might be
true but nobody will ever know.</p><p>Things that did happen in 1980-81.</p><ol><li><p><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes\\">Roland Barthes</a>was hit by a laundry van after having lunch with
Mitterrand; the papers he was carrying were stolen,  and he died a month later of his injuries.</p></li><li><p><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Althusser\\">Louis Althusser</a>strangled his wife in what the courts consider an
episode of insanity.</p></li><li><p>Right-wing terrorists<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_massacre\\">bombed Bologna’s central train station</a>,
killing 85 people.</p></li><li><p>Mitterrand won the first of several elections as President of France.</p></li></ol><p>Things that didn’t:</p><ol><li><p><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida\\">Jacques Derrida</a>was<em>not</em>killed by attack dogs unleashed on Cornell
University campus by<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle\\">John Searle</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Sollers\\">Philippe Sollers</a>was<em>not</em>castrated as a consequence of
losing a semioticians’ fight-club debate with Umberto Eco.</p></li></ol><p>Things we’ll never know:</p><ol><li><p>How did Mitterrand hang on to office for so long?</p></li><li><p>What happened to Barthes’ papers?</p></li></ol><h2 id=\\"p-1\\">Fun as in fun</h2><p>Seriously, I kept laughing out loud.  While there’s deep thinking here about language and meaning, there are fabulous chase scenes,
appalling violence, sexual fireworks on a dissecting table, mysterious Japanese ninjas, and a whole lot of sex & drugs &
rock-n-roll. And tennis.</p><p>And name-dropping; the whole book is one big name-drop, and a lot of the names are portrayed having inappropriate sex and taking
inappropriate drugs.  But he does it so well that you can’t help but be amused.  Well, except for some of those portrayed are still
very alive and might not be; can you sue someone for the way they portray you in a work of fiction?
For example, I wonder if a certain prominent female American gender theorist will object to having been
portrayed as sodomizing a burly French policeman in a threesome including a prominent female French poststructuralist?</p><p>Anyhow, by now you probably know whether you’re a candidate to enjoy this one.</p></div>",

The band was grizzled, grey, and genial; when Nick closed by saying “We hope you had as

was that of well-bred Englishmen, dry and mild.</p><blockquote><p>Nick’s opening remarks:<i>Hi there.

The concept is
that, since the various Floyd incarnations mostly perform numbers starting with<cite>Dark Side of the Moon</cite>but there was a
lot of good pre-<cite>Dark Side</cite>Floyd, that’s what Nick and the boys are playing.<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Saucerful_of_Secrets\\">A Saucerful of Secrets</a>, from 1968, was Floyd’s second album, but

songs they played</a>(setlist.fm is remarkable). I knew maybe half, where by “knew” means they’re buried in my hindbrain
from unimaginably
long ago.</p><blockquote><p>Nick:<i>Hi Vancouver, nice to be back.  Last time I was here was… 1970. Anyone here remember 1970?  Neither do
I.</i></p></blockquote><p>Wikipedia says: “The band includes long-time Pink Floyd and David Gilmour bass player Guy Pratt; Blockheads guitarist Lee Harris;
Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp on guitar and vocals; and producer/composer Dom Beken on keyboards.”</p><blockquote><p>Nick:<i>Let me introduce the Saucers.</i></p></blockquote><p>We were down near the stage, so got too much guitar and not enough drums/voice - on Set the Controls, Nick's epic tom-tom rhythm
was sadly dim.
The sound would have been guitar-heavy wherever you sat, but (once the sound guys had a chance to settle things down in the early minutes)
pretty clean.  Well, except for where the band wanted a chaotic noise crescendo.</p><blockquote><p>Nick, introducing<cite>Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun</cite>:<i>Looking forward to this one.  I spent
years touring with a fellow - nice guy, wonderful writer<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>but he was greedy about hitting the
gong. Tonight I get my chance!</i></p></blockquote><p>The highlights were just what you’d expect:<cite>Astronomy Domine</cite>,<cite>Fearless</cite>,<cite>If</cite>,<cite>Set the
Controls</cite>,<cite>One of These Days</cite>.  Then there was this other tune, not that loud, no vocals,
and a lovely familiar bass line, but I couldn’t place it. The setlist gave it away:<cite>Atom Heart Mother!</cite>Of course, when
you take away the string section, the horn section, the choir chanting in Basque (or maybe Swahili or Ojibway?), and the lyric
soprano, it can't be quite the same.</p><blockquote><p>Guy Pratt, before<cite>Nile Song</cite>:<cite>Let’s play some dumbass rock&roll!</cite>After:<i>We were
setting up for a David Gilmour tour, and he asked us for song suggestions. I suggested</i>Nile Song<i>, and he suggested I
find another band. So I have!</i></p></blockquote><p>There was a nice tribute to Syd Barrett by way of a performance of<cite>Vegetable Man</cite>, never performed live by anyone
before this tour.</p><blockquote><p>Nick:<i>That sounds unfinished, maybe Sid came to an end before the song did.  But none of this would’ve happened if it
hadn’t been for him, you know.</i></p></blockquote><p>Both my kids were rockin’ and rollin’ in their seats, particularly on the closing charge through<cite>One of these Days</cite>,
which works really well live with a lot of heavy guitar.  That made me smile.</p><blockquote><p>Gary Kemp:<i>I went and saw Pink Floyd at Wembley Stadium when I was (sorry, Nick) only fourteen, they were playing<cite>Dark Side</cite>, and I found that I couldn’t stop looking at Nick drumming.  Well, to be fair, he was the only person in the
room who was moving.</i></p></blockquote><p>I’ve always loved<cite>Set the Controls</cite>and I loved hearing it live; the performance wasn’t like any of the recordings
I’ve heard, and no, I wouldn’t say it was<em>better</em>than either the<cite>UmmaGumma</cite>or<cite>Live at Pompeii</cite>takes, but it
was different and fresh and that tune, it’ll be going through my head for weeks.</p><p>But what hit me the hardest was<cite>If</cite>(“If I were a swan, I’d be gone”) which they dressed up with a big high-drama
middle-section instrumental.  And its closing line speaks directly to me.  As I edge into old age, speech becomes more effortful. The
inside of my head is a comfy albeit cluttered place to be, and a lot of the things I might want to say would require too much
explanation to be easy. But silence is; too easy.</p><blockquote><p><i>If I were a good man<br/>I’d talk with you<br/>more often than I do.</i></p></blockquote></div>",

This problem is technical and personal and I felt it ought not to go unrecognized.</p><img src=\\"Adiumy.png\\" alt=\\"Adiumy\\" class=\\"inline\\"/><p>Since forever I’ve used a chat client called<a href=\\"https://adium.im/\\">Adium</a>; it’s open-source, has a good, polished, flexible UX, and is self-updating. The people I
talked to, some of them were on AIM, ICQ, on various flavors of Jabber and XMPP and then, in latter years, Google+.
What’s happening is, they’re going away.  The chat connections I mean, although many of those underlying services are winking out
too, one by one.</p><p>(That’s the Adium mascot, “Adiumy”, on the right.)</p><p>For those to whom those terms “Jabber” and “XMPP” are new, they represented the idea that any chat service should be able to talk
to any other chat service, so you could use whichever you liked best, and hang with your friends wherever on the Net they hung their
chatty hats.</p><p>There was a time when commercial chat services supported XMPP because it was felt to be the right thing to do.
But that was old-school hippie thinking, because if chatterers can just go ahead and talk to anyone anywhere,
then<em>your</em>service probably won’t go viral and how are you going to monetize?  You can simultaneously think markets are
a useful civic tool and recognize obvious, egregious failures.  So the links were severed and a whole lot of services just died.</p><p>At one point, my Adium typically listed literally hundreds of people I might choose to talk with, with a red or green “available”
glyph; they were grayed-out of they weren’t signed in.</p><p>These days, more and more are always grayed out, because they were on some other service that’s no longer connected.  It makes me
sad, because I can no longer say “Hey, qq?” when I want to. So I thought I’d cut and paste some of those people. The world being
what it is, chances are there are lots that I’ll never chat with again.</p><p>So I’m going to tour through maybe 1% of the names in my chat window, for its own sake and to say I haven’t forgotten.</p><p>The top of the Adium window just now, only two people currently showing logged-in and available.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Green.png\\" alt=\\"Phipps and Sharpe\\"/><p><a href=\\"https://meshedinsights.com/\\">Simon</a>, long time open-source maven, is an important figure in my life.

I think this piece will anchor an “LP Log” blog series in which I touch on the LPs’ payloads  as I (slowly) work through the
vinyl backlog. Also, as the picture below makes clear, I may have to do a bit of furniture shopping because it’s not as though I
have enough shelf space for more than a small fraction of these.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/23/IMG_20190119_133007.png\\" alt=\\"Cat walking around on 900 used LPs\\"/><div class=\\"caption\\"><p>Cat for scale.</p></div><p>Just a couple of weeks before, I’d noticed that the old<a href=\\"https://www.linn.co.uk/\\">Linn</a>cartridge on my lovely<a href=\\"/ongoing/When/201x/2010/03/04/Record-Player\\">Simon Yorke “Series 9”</a>had crapped out.  I can’t complain, it had served
me well and it was at least fifteen years old.
So I needed a new one and,
since I was staring at 900 probably-not-that-pristine records in the face, something to restore & rejuvenate them.</p><h2 id=\\"p-1\\">Record cleaner</h2><p>A survey of the audiophile press suggests that the cleaners from<a href=\\"https://www.vpiindustries.com/\\">VPI</a>offer a good price/quality combination.  The<a href=\\"https://www.vpiindustries.com/hw165\\">VPI HW 16.5</a>looked good but hard to buy in Canada, until I
visited eBay, where they seem to appear regularly. It’s at least a decade since I bought anything at eBay; they seem to be
getting along without me. I missed out on a couple of auctions but eventually scored, probably
paying a little too much, jumping the bid by $50 in the closing seconds.</p><img src=\\"VPI-HW-16.5.png\\" alt=\\"VPI HW 16.5\\"/><p>Cleaning LPs with the machine is just massively cool.  First you screw the record down, spin up the turntable, and slather it with
cleaning solution (20% isopropyl).  Then you hit the vacuum switch and a hollow
cylindrical arm with velvety brushes comes down on the disc and sucks the fluid right back in.  Two revolutions of the turntable are
plenty.
It’s pretty remarkable to see an LP go on looking grungy and dim, and come off gleaming.</p><p>There are lots of videos on YouTube, but in most of them the actual action shot is embedded in a lengthy “review”.<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnNNfGoqFI\\">This one</a>is blurry and shaky but gets right to the point.</p><p>The guy in the video uses a specialized record-cleaning brush.  I didn’t have one in that style, so used a standard
super-soft-bristle paintbrush and that works fine.</p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">The cartridge</h2><p>High-end audio is bloody expensive, and I have never previously purchased a component without listening to it, playing music of
my own that I know and love.  With the exception of cartridges; dealers are understandably reluctant to keep lots of tiny fragile
objects in stock and let customers drop them on their own crappy vinyl.  So it was a matter of reading reviews.  Boy, are there ever
a lot of cartridges out there.  One decent survey is the long-running<cite>Recommended Components</cite>published twice yearly by<cite>Stereophile</cite>magazine. Check out the Fall-2018<a href=\\"https://www.stereophile.com/content/recommended-components-fall-2018-edition-turntables-tonearms-cartridges-etc\\">Turntables,
Tonearms, and Cartridges</a>section.</p><p>Ordering high-end online doesn’t seem to be much of a thing so I got a local retailer, Vancouver’s<a href=\\"https://hificentre.com/\\">Hi-Fi Centre</a>, to order it in. The store is really a super pleasant place to visit.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/23/IMG_20190220_123243.png\\" alt=\\"The Hi-Fi Centre in Vancouver\\"/><p>My conversation with the guy there was a little sad.  It’s a nice place, they seem to be doing well, but their customers are
mostly over 50.  I may be among the last generations to care enough about audio quality to do this sort of this stuff.  For most
people these days, a Sonos or an Amazon Echo or whatever that brings tunes to where they are will do the job.  Me, I hope to spend
a few more years of evenings sitting up late in a comfy chair with a small adult beverage, spinning the discs and listening,<em>really listening</em>, to them.</p><p>After a lot of grinding back and forth and looking for second opinions on the net, I settled on the<a href=\\"http://www.dynavector.com/products/cart/e_20x2.html\\">Dynavector DV-20X2</a>(low-output option), made (by hand, they say)
in Japan.  My reasons: The price
was within the bounds of sanity.  It’s been described as easy to set up. Relative to many other good cartridges, it has
relatively high “compliance”, which means it should be easier on the records, most of which are totally irreplaceable. Finally, a
couple of reviewers said it did a great job on rock & roll.  Yes, I know I have 900 classical records to consider, but I also know
where my heart lives.  Here it is, in action.</p><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/23/DSCF0222.png\\" alt=\\"Dynavector DV-20X2 Low on a Simon Yorke Series Nine\\"/><img src=\\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/23/TFT22355.png\\" alt=\\"Dynavector DV-20X2 Low on a Simon Yorke Series Nine\\"/><p>Getting it set up was a major pain in the ass. I couldn’t turn up the original turntable documentation, but
fortunately, it’s a major enough issue that there were two different places out on the net that talked through the process. It
doesn’t help that I have shaky hands and am at best modestly dextrous.  If Simon Yorke comes to read this (he’s retired but I think
still living): It’s a great turntable, Simon, but getting the vertical tracking angle right is<em>awful</em>!  If Lauren hadn’t
helped I never would have managed.</p><img src=\\"Dusty_in_Memphis.png\\" alt=\\"Dusty in Memphis\\" class=\\"inline\\"/><h2 id=\\"p-3\\">Dusty!</h2><p>Finally, it was all tightened down and the wires plugged in.  For the turntable’s first outing, I put on a pristine copy of<a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_in_Memphis\\">Dusty in Memphis</a>that I’d bought but never played after discovering
that my cartridge was busted.</p><p>Oh. My. God. Should have upgraded the cartridge years ago.  If you haven’t heard good vinyl on good hardware I really don’t have
any words that I think will convey the experience.  I mean, it helps that at that moment in 1969 Dusty had cosmic mojo, fabulous
producers, and took on a list of classics.  I guess the most famous would be<cite>Windmills of Your Mind</cite>, but there are
plenty more jewels.</p><p>Also, it’s a production triumph. The arrangements are cool, the musicians are razor-sharp, and the recording is just slightly on
the dirty side of pristine, which is exactly what you want; it really does that thing that vinyl is (in my mind) a little better at
than digital<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>creating the illusion of a bunch of musicians down at that end of the room.</p><p><i>When you knew that it was over, you were suddenly aware<br/>that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of his hair.</i></p></div>",

There’s Skype ’n’ TeamViewer ’n’ Zoom ’n’ Webex ’n’ our own<a href=\\"https://aws.amazon.com/chime/\\">Chime</a>’n’ GoToMeeting ’n’ join.me and they all suck in their own unlovable idiosyncratic
ways. The visual glitches I can tolerate, but the audio problems make me want to scream; dropouts, static, echoes, the noise of
hands softly leafing through a document drowning out any non-booming voice.</p><p>In my decades-long career, I’ve used one videoconferencing system that was reliable and almost always Just Worked. It was by
Polycom, but then the infrastructure people said “super old school” and replaced it with something modern that often doesn’t. I
suspect darkly that the technology is passable but a bean-counter somewhere has refused to buy enough bandwidth to make it sing?
Blecch.</p><h2 id=\\"p-2\\">Screens</h2><p>The amount of screen real-estate per geek grows monotonically. Dual-27\\" screens plus your laptop’s own screen are table
stakes, and I’m seeing the occasional massive 50\\"-plus 4K screen. I asked one guy
“How can you<em>use</em>all that space?” He said “I can’t of course, all the stuff I’m actively working on is in the middle third,
bottom half. But having everything else within visible reach is such a win.”  OK then.</p><p>I have to admit that I’m becoming increasingly conscious that the pixels on my<a href=\\"/ongoing/When/201x/2016/02/24/Dell-U3415W\\">curved 34\\" Dell U3415W</a><em>are</em>in fact visible,
and the contrast between that and my Retina laptop screens is a perceptible irritant. #FirstWorldProblem.</p><h2 id=\\"p-3\\">Desks</h2><p>The proportion that are motorized is higher every quarter.  I’d find it hard to live without mine.  The mix of people standing
and sitting makes the otherwise-dreary rows of software-engineer desks a little easier on the eye, which welcomes disorderly human
distributions.</p><h2 id=\\"p-4\\">Office space</h2><p>Since I mentioned it: All the high-tech companies I’ve worked for have resolutely ignored the research I hear about that seems to
say putting expensive engineers out on the floor with no separating walls leads to grievous productivity losses. Isn’t this biz
supposed to be data-driven?</p><h2 id=\\"p-5\\">Diversity</h2><p>We do<a href=\\"/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/09/D-and-I-training\\">work on the problem</a>, but the gender ratios are still not good.</p><p>If you can get past that (I can’t) there are grounds for good cheer.  Here in Vancouver we draw from the very considerable
Canadian talent pool, but our immigration law lets us hire major distributed-systems talent from almost anywhere in the
world.
The resulting mix actually makes me feel optimistic about humanity; the AWS Service groups that
surround me offer visible in-the-flesh proof that there’s plenty of software talent in any ethnic, linguistic, or geographic slice
across the membership of<i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p><p>I’m amused that when chance lands two engineers on a problem who happen to share a native
tongue, they immediately drop out of English and into Polish or some south-central Han dialect or whatever it is Nigerian
geeks speak to each other.  There’s this one group near me that has three guys named Muhammad; one them is called by his actual name, then
there’s “Mo” and “Momo”. It seems to work, and by the way Momo seems to be the leading expert on AWS Region Build Automation, which
is a big freaking hairy deal around here. Protip to the industry: If you’re not recruiting out of West Africa, you’re missing out on
major engineering talent.</p><h2 id=\\"p-6\\">Darkness</h2><p>I’m talking about screens. What with the advent of Mojave, light text on a dark background has officially re-entered the GUI
mainstream.  But more or less all the younger engineers had already switched their IDEs over to light-on-dark. My
white-background IntelliJ and Goland screens mark me as a dinosaur.</p><p>I’ve cared deeply about typography and presentation for a long
time and the issues here are interesting. I freely acknowledge that my preference for dark-on-light is probably an artifact of my
having tuned my brain, in my youth, to ink-on-paper.  Since screens are, at the end of the day, light-displaying devices, there’s an
argument that the natural on-screen design language for typography and information display is light-on-dark. I wonder if there’s
quantitative research in the space?</p><h2 id=\\"p-7\\">Speaking of IDEs</h2><p>I guess the big story is the decline of Eclipse from “more or less everybody’s default” to “there are still people using it”.  VS
Code has momentum
but IntelliJ has a plenty of loyalists, and then the front-end tribe are often in Atom and Sublime.  I’m happy to report that
neither Vim nor Emacs have gone away.  But recently our license server was having problems and I couldn’t use Goland and found the Emacs
go-mode story pretty weak.</p><h2 id=\\"p-8\\">Speaking of languages</h2><p>It’s no secret that the Internet still runs, more than anything else, on Java. Could be worse, I remember when it all ran on PHP
and Perl. And I don’t want to diss Java<em>too</em>much.  The tooling story is exceptional, and once your JVM gets properly warmed
up, there’s nothing that runs usefully faster. And these days, for new stuff you should spell Java “Kotlin”.  Especially since if
you let those young pups who won’t get off my lawn use Java, they’ll emit all this Java 8+ stream/lambda stuff that is easy to make
indecipherable.</p><p>What’s happening out on the front-end frontier, the Cambrian explosion of JS-based technologies, makes me happy that I mostly
don’t go there.</p><p>On the back end where I live, we’ve got Go and Rust creeping in big-time. I’m no longer surprised when I pull up some package
buried deep in our serverless infrastructure and it turns out to be in Go. Well, and for serverless code too, if only because of the
fast startup.</p><p>If you live in the world of ML or data science, you’re using Python; you don’t have a choice and it’s not
terrible.</p><p>Then Rust, for when you get close to the metal.  There was an internal new-languages thread where someone said “If you can’t
tolerate GC, use Rust. Otherwise use Go.”  Sounds reasonable.
A few zealots are saying everything new should be in Rust because otherwise you’re being
wilfullly unsafe. But I like having the runtime manage memory for me, whenever I can get away with it.</p><h2 id=\\"p-9\\">Inside the software</h2><p>REST is still a really good way to piece pieces of the software world together. Of course, what with the rise of HTTP/2 and QUIC,
what the programmer thinks of as RESTful requests are something quite other, out on the wire.  This feels about like us
thinking we’re using x86 instructions on our silicon even though what the circuits are doing is really totally different.</p><p>To the extent that interfaces aren’t REST, they’re mostly event streams of one kind or another. Where by “Event” I mean “JSON
blob”; by and large good enough.  This is the area I’m working on this year, lots of opportunities for improvement.</p><p>The good news: Each generation of devs that comes along is a little more test-infected than its predecessors.  I still run
across islands of ignorance where they think it’s OK to ship code now and do the unit tests later (as if that ever happens), but
less and less each year.</p><h2 id=\\"p-10\\">Which computers?</h2><p>Still more Macs than anything else, although there’s an undeniable Windows renaissance. Having said that, even the smart people
with the coolest Surface devices are often bitching about problems with things called “drivers”<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>what
are those for, anyhow?<span class=\\"dashes\\">—</span>and lockups, and saying “Sorry, just a moment while I get my computer going”.</p><p>If I were a little less aged and cynical, I’d be boiling over with anger at Apple’s inexcusable stewardship of the Mac franchise;<a href=\\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/my_2018_apple_report_card\\">Gruber’s “D” grade</a>is maybe even generous. This is a
product that used to feature instant wake-up (gone), MagSafe (gone), lots of useful I/O ports including SD card readers (gone), a
good built-in photo editor (gone), and the world’s best keyboards (gone). It absolutely shocks me that a company can get away with
making its product successively
worse and then worse again, year after year. Among other things it speaks to how good the core design of MacOS is.</p><p>But maybe 2020 is the year of Linux on the desktop?</p></div>",
