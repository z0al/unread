			<title>53: Embrace the PHP with Next.js, Featuring Tim Neutkens</title>

			<description>Have you had the privilege of working in PHP?

If you haven't let me tell you:
You can have a dynamic website just by putting a single PHP file on a host, anywhere.

It's magic

For us React developers, everything is a lot more complicated.

We want server-side rendering for Google crawl-ability,
Hot Module Replacement for quick feedback in development, and code-splitting to get quick initial page loads for users.

None of that is easy to implement.

But there's hope.

The team at Zeit wants you to have all that but with the simplicity of that beautiful PHP workflow.

And they've done it.

We sit with Tim Neutkens, lead developer on Nextjs, an open source framework, for react, by Zeit.

He tells us how you can get back to that beautiful, fun PHP experience but with all of the benefits of SSR, HMR, AMP, and so many more initialisms.

I'm so excited to share this chat about Next.js the next-live of static site generation.

			<description>Navigating a career is tricky.
This is double true for women in tech.
Add a spouses career,
traditional gender expectations,
Single-parenting,
Or illness to the mix
And finding a satisfying career can feel impossible.

Today, Sophia Shoemaker sits with us to discuss how she manages being a mom in tech, conference speaker, FullStack React editor, and deeply invested in her community.

It's a different story than many of you are used to hearing on this show.
A more complicated one.
I'm excited that we get to learn more about one of the types of challenges that women in tech face today.

And I'm so grateful that Sophia brought us into her story.

I know that her experience can give you hope — as you find a career that works for your specific cocktail of complications.

			<title>51: Michel Westrate Wants You To Stop Writing State Reducers</title>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">586972d8-62b0-4d3d-bd35-cc2f4640662d</guid>

			<description>How many times have you written a state reducer?
100 times?
100 times a month?

Truth is, it's tricky for human brains to write performant state mutations in immutable terms.

Maybe you're whip smart and you've got the theory on lock but the resulting "spread hell" is hard to read and edit long term.

Michel Westrate wants you to stop writing state updates with immutable APIs like spread, concat, and slice and take a second look at mutable APIs like property assignment, forEach, and push.

He's made it really easy
And the React Team finds this idea very interesting.

We talk with Michel about this wild of idea of state producers (not reducers) in Immer, why they're in the spirit of React, his MobX fame, and why — even in 2019 — it's not a good idea to roll your own state management library.

Listen cautiously though.
After this episode, you may never write a state reducer again...

			<description>Versioning. How do we do it? It's a lot more complicated than "just use semver!"
This week Michael Jackson joins us again to discuss the pains of versioning, how to avoid them, and why it all comes down to communication.

Chantastic asks about upcoming how React Router v5 will take advantage of new features like Hooks and what versioning strategy they intend to employ with for legacy React Router users.

They fumble clumsily around what the various characters in a package.json file mean, discuss outrageous prefixing as a defense mechanism, and partying at the 2019 JSConfUS in Carlsbad.

			<itunes:summary>Versioning. How do we do it? It's a lot more complicated than "just use semver!"
This week Michael Jackson joins us again to discuss the pains of versioning, how to avoid them, and why it all comes down to communication.

Chantastic asks about upcoming how React Router v5 will take advantage of new features like Hooks and what versioning strategy they intend to employ with for legacy React Router users.

They fumble clumsily around what the various characters in a package.json file mean, discuss outrageous prefixing as a defense mechanism, and partying at the 2019 JSConfUS in Carlsbad.
